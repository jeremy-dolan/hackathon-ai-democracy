Our group's overarching project investigated U.S. federal agencies' public comment systems vulnerability to AI-driven manipulation. This notebook demonstrates the automated generation of arbitrarily-many diverse, fake public comments from fictitious persons responding to proposed federal rules and regulations (as posted to [regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/)).\n",

        "executive_summary = f\"Since 1980, the total cost to receive a four-year postsecondary credential has nearly tripled, even after accounting for inflation. Pell Grants once covered nearly 80 percent of the cost of a four-year public college degree for students from low- and middle-income families, but now they only cover a third of those costs. This price growth has dramatically increased the need for students to secure student loans, particularly Federal student loans from the Department, to cover their educational costs. The gap between prices and income means that many students from low- and middle-income families have to borrow Federal student loans in addition to grants and out-of-pocket spending so they can earn a postsecondary credential. These trends have resulted in cumulative Federal loan debt of $1.6 trillion and rising for more than 43 million borrowers, which has placed a significant financial burden upon middle-income borrowers and has had an even more devastating impact on vulnerable low-income borrowers.\\n\\nAfter convening the Student Loan Debt Relief negotiated rulemaking committee (Committee) and reaching consensus on various issues discussed in this NPRM, the Department proposes regulations, in accordance with the Secretary's authority to waive repayment of a loan provided by section 432(a) of the HEA, to provide debt relief targeted to address certain specific circumstances as part of a comprehensive effort to address the burden of Federal student loan debt. The proposed regulations would modify the Department's existing debt collection regulations to provide greater specificity regarding the Secretary's discretion to waive Federal student loan debt and specify the Secretary's authority to waive all or part of any debts owed to the Department based on a number of different circumstances, such as growth in a borrower's loan balance beyond what was owed upon entering repayment, the amount of time since the loan first entered repayment, whether the borrower meets certain criteria for loan forgiveness or discharge under existing authority, and whether a loan was obtained to attend an institution or program that was subject to secretarial actions, that closed prior to secretarial actions, or was associated with closed Gainful Employment programs with high debt-to-earnings rates or low median earnings.\"\n",

            "Background: James Kent grew up in Lake Victorland, Ohio, where his family had lived for generations. He was the youngest of five siblings, and his parents owned a small hardware store on Main Street. After high school, James worked at the store alongside his parents, eventually taking over the business when they retired. He married his high school sweetheart, Susan, and they had two children, Emily and Ryan. James was an active member of the community, coaching Little League and serving on the local Chamber of Commerce. After Susan passed away suddenly in her early 50s, James continued to run the hardware store, but his heart wasn't in it. He sold the business a few years ago and now spends his days puttering around his garden, volunteering at the local animal shelter, and spoiling his grandkids rotten. Despite the struggles he's faced, James remains a kind and optimistic soul, always willing to lend a helping hand or offer a sympathetic ear.\n",

            "<summary>\n",
            "Since 1980, the total cost to receive a four-year postsecondary credential has nearly tripled, even after accounting for inflation. Pell Grants once covered nearly 80 percent of the cost of a four-year public college degree for students from low- and middle-income families, but now they only cover a third of those costs. This price growth has dramatically increased the need for students to secure student loans, particularly Federal student loans from the Department, to cover their educational costs. The gap between prices and income means that many students from low- and middle-income families have to borrow Federal student loans in addition to grants and out-of-pocket spending so they can earn a postsecondary credential. These trends have resulted in cumulative Federal loan debt of $1.6 trillion and rising for more than 43 million borrowers, which has placed a significant financial burden upon middle-income borrowers and has had an even more devastating impact on vulnerable low-income borrowers.\n",
            "\n",
            "After convening the Student Loan Debt Relief negotiated rulemaking committee (Committee) and reaching consensus on various issues discussed in this NPRM, the Department proposes regulations, in accordance with the Secretary's authority to waive repayment of a loan provided by section 432(a) of the HEA, to provide debt relief targeted to address certain specific circumstances as part of a comprehensive effort to address the burden of Federal student loan debt. The proposed regulations would modify the Department's existing debt collection regulations to provide greater specificity regarding the Secretary's discretion to waive Federal student loan debt and specify the Secretary's authority to waive all or part of any debts owed to the Department based on a number of different circumstances, such as growth in a borrower's loan balance beyond what was owed upon entering repayment, the amount of time since the loan first entered repayment, whether the borrower meets certain criteria for loan forgiveness or discharge under existing authority, and whether a loan was obtained to attend an institution or program that was subject to secretarial actions, that closed prior to secretarial actions, or was associated with closed Gainful Employment programs with high debt-to-earnings rates or low median earnings.\n",

            "I have over $95,000 in student loan debt and $60,000 plus is from interest alone. I haven’t been able to qualify for any debt forgiveness through any of the programs. I have four years that count towards PSLF, however, I was being sexually harassed by the administrator and had to quit. (He was found guilty by the facilities lawyer and fired) Since then the facility has been sold to a corporation and is no longer a non profit. There are very very limited non profits and the ones that are in my area do not pay enough for how expensive it is to just make it these days. I need a new vehicle but am unable to afford payments due to my student loan payments. I’m fully aware that I had a loan and loans are to be paid back, but this interest that has accrued should be a crime. I have no debt relief in the near future and it’s very debilitating. I have four children and raised them on my own and went to nursing school to better myself for my children to have a better life. I worked the frontline on Covid units in the trenches of the nursing home where we were all those residents had. I feel like I’ve been just given this massive amount of money to owe and to pay back for the rest of my life and it’s a slap in the face from everything we’ve been through during Covid lockdown, not to mention the PTSD most of us in healthcare have now from the things we’ve had to endure and witness. I’m not asking for a handout, I’m asking for a life changing opportunity! Please! I want to be able to continue to provide for myself and my family and having the interest wiped away would tremendously benefit. Thank you for your time. \n",
