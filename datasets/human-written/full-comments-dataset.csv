I was in PSLF for many years now but had to leave that sector of the workforce and all the interest that capitalized on my account due to this program and the income based payments has left me with a higher balance than my original principal from 14 years ago. Many years of capitalized interest. Also, no payments should be based on income of both spouses for married couples. Married couples are unfairly punished for filing taxes together, a long time standard in this country but being married seems to serve no purpose these days. My spouse should not be held accountable for my payments. This needs to be fixed. Payments should only be based on my income, regardless of tax filing status. Forgiveness should be based on and individual’s income, regardless of filing status. Also, PSLF should be less than 10 years. Undergrad degrees are 4 years only but public service takes 10??  I also feel my degree was worthless. The major I enrolled in got me nowhere. I was misguided. I also attended a school for one year and transferred but that school has since closed. Now I’m paying a loan to a school that doesn’t exists anymore. Change the latest round of forgiveness to individual loans of up to $12k, not $12k combined. I have 4 individual loans, all less than $12k from 4 years of school.  This is where borrowers will really be helped by looking at individual loans.","Student",,,,,,

Due to these students and parents being so far in debt they are unable to do basic things like buy a home, vehicle or save for retirement.  The middle class has not been able to get much financial aid and the only way that our children have been able to attend college is through obtaining Parent Plus Loans.  I am disappointed that these loans were not included in this program like they had been in the previous program that was shut down by Congress.  I am a parent that has Parent Plus loans for both of my children and the interest alone has doubled my balance.  I am barely able to make the minimum payments each month and there is no way that my children would be able to make the payments on their salaries along with the loans in their names.

First, I generally support a one time maneuver to relieve our future and emerging labor force with high student debt, providing those eligible are contributing to state and federal tax earnings, and those individuals are legal residents of the U.S. Secondly, I would encourage greater focus on removing interest (over eliminating major sums of primary loan balances). With this program, there are clear risks of worsening inflation and the potential to add billions to an already exorbitant federal debt level — these should be major concerns. One would hope liberating high interest loan burdens would stimulate those impacted to better support and engage in the economy and build more productive lives, but prior attempts (e.g., stimulus programs, etc) by both administration from both Parties have shown mixed results. Thus, I advocate for more conservative measures and means to assess the real impact of this program (before larger investments are made); I would recommend narrowing the earnings limits to yield a smaller program, focused on supporting the most vulnerable. I would defer to Administration scientists and analysts to determine rational cut-off points, but reducing the size of the proposed program by 25-35% might be a suggested goal and one that will win more support across the political spectrum. Should the results be consistent with the Administration’s projections and indeed show net favorable economic benefits, then it would make a strong case for expanding the plan. As a final point, I believe Americans should have a clear understanding of the demographics of those their tax dollars are supporting, such as the types and state geographies of institutions attended, in person versus online programs, institutional quality (% regionally accredited versus accredited by another specialized accreditation body etc.), loan holders’ disciplines being supported e.g., teachers, nurses, law enforcement, liberal arts majors, etc.), geographies where they are employed. For example, questions that arise in my mind are how many loans are forgiven / interest reduced to individuals that are employed in “essential” jobs? Or high demand jobs (as defined by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics)? How many attended 4 year public or private universities, versus trade schools or community colleges, versus for profit institutions. If those individuals awarded relief currently hold unpaid tax balances with the IRS, will the government still issue the relief in the same way? Provided it can done in confidential fashion, I also believe the Administration would be served if report on the number of individuals served by this program, who are educationally and/or economically disadvantaged, who are disabled, and who are members of the active military or Veteran.

Finally, I would encourage the Administration to assemble a team of experts or convene listening sessions in which higher education leaders, policymakers, student advocates, lenders, economists and others can critically evaluate the drivers, policies, practices and other factors that have contributed to the current unfavorable state and need for this program, such that we can learn, adapt and position the country for a healthier posture related to higher education, student debt, and prosperity. 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment and for the Administration’s dedication to higher education and its students and graduates, recognizing the impactful role the U.S. higher education system has on innovation, social mobility, an informed and civil population, and the overall advancement of a prosperous society and truth.

Unfortunately, this proposed legislation does nothing to address this gap and, in fact, per tables 3.2, 3.6, and 3.7, primarily provide relief for undergraduate debt, widening this gap further. The SAVE plan reduces undergraduate student loan payments to 5% of income but keeps graduate loans at 10%, the same as the current PAYE plan.

For many with graduate student debt, there is no clear benefit of switching from PAYE to SAVE. The extended payment period from 20 to 25 years under SAVE may end up being far more expensive for many borrowers who switch from PAYE to SAVE, as they don't know what their financial situation will be 10 or 20 years from now. 

Something needs to be done to incentivize graduate school education in America, such as reducing the payment requirement from 10% of income to 7.5%. Even the text of this proposed regulation estimates that most of the forgiveness will impact undergraduate borrowers.","Institution of Higher Education",,,,,,

Throughout my journey, I have consistently made payments, even during periods of deferment and forbearance during residency and fellowship. It is disheartening to see that the proposed policy on student loan forgiveness appears to favor those who have allowed their debt to accumulate rather than those who have responsibly managed their obligations.

The exclusion of borrowers like myself, who have diligently paid down their debt over time, raises significant questions about the equity and fairness of the proposed measures. Why should forgiveness be limited only to individuals whose current balance exceeds their original debt? This approach fails to acknowledge the efforts of responsible borrowers and undermines the principle of fairness.

Furthermore, the selective nature of this policy, seemingly aimed at garnering votes from younger demographics, raises concerns about its true intentions. Student loan forgiveness should not be used as a political tool, but rather as a means to address the systemic challenges facing borrowers of all ages and backgrounds.

If genuine relief is the goal, then it must be extended to all borrowers, regardless of their current balance or repayment history. A balanced approach that considers the circumstances of every individual is essential to ensure fairness and justice in student loan policy.

I urge the committee to reconsider the proposed policy and adopt a more inclusive approach to student loan forgiveness—one that acknowledges the efforts of responsible borrowers and provides relief to all who are burdened by student debt.","Student",,,,,,

While I appreciate the efforts being made to address the issue, I believe there are crucial aspects that need further consideration to truly alleviate the burden on borrowers like myself.

Firstly, I urge the federal government to increase the household income threshold outlined in the proposal. Many Americans living in areas with a higher cost of living significantly impacts our ability to meet repayment obligations. By adjusting this threshold, you would ensure that borrowers in such areas are not unfairly excluded from the benefits of the plan.

Furthermore, I implore you to extend the scope of the plan to include graduate students who have diligently made payments for over a decade. Many of us have witnessed our debt balloon due to exorbitant numbers dur to predatory interest rates, despite faithfully fulfilling our repayment obligations. The current structure of income-driven repayment (IDR) programs has left us in a perpetual cycle of debt, where even repaying the original principal seems insurmountable.

While initiatives like the SAVE program are steps in the right direction, they fail to adequately address the issue of interest accumulation over years of repayment. I strongly advocate for a mechanism that credits borrowers for the interest paid during extended periods of repayment. This adjustment would provide much-needed relief to those of us who have been tirelessly chipping away at our loans for years without seeing a significant dent in the principal amount owed.

It's essential to recognize that for many of us, student loan debt has become a barrier to achieving milestones such as homeownership and starting a family. With balances surpassing even mortgage amounts, our financial stability and future prospects are severely hindered. By implementing measures that acknowledge the realities of long-term borrowers, the government can offer a pathway towards financial freedom and empower individuals to pursue their aspirations without the burden of crippling debt.

Thank you for considering my feedback and for your commitment to addressing the student loan crisis. I remain hopeful that together, we can find equitable solutions that benefit borrowers across the nation.

Stop buying votes and stop spending the taxpayers money.  This is insane.  What's next?  Sign a mortgage, but expect to have it dissolved?  What are we teaching people?

Second, if the loan is forgiven by the federal government, someone still has to give that money back to the company that guaranteed the loan. In this case, that would be the American taxpayer. Being responsible means paying one's debts, and in this case, it falls on the debtor not the American taxpayer. People had a choice whether to go to college, university, trade school, or not any of those things. In this case, the American taxpayer would not have a choice but be forced to pay for something that they did not agree to.

I think they took the items that they felt were being over-taxed and threw them into the harbor. I think this happened near Boston. I think their main complaint was that they felt they were being overtaxed and their complaints were not being heard. It would seem that our current President is acting more like a king and less like a politician voted into office.

I will not accept taking on other debt by another person who, inevitably, hasn't fulfilled their contractual requirements.

Make it published and let the future loan holders know what it will take for them to have loans partially forgiven; a known incentive for a known program.   This damn program is nothing more than buying political votes!   Why is it being rushed through so fast?    Erasing debt from borrowers does nothing to educate the person in assuming and managing debt.

This is nothing more than placing a band-aid on a much larger unaddressed problem.  This issue is the responsibility of the Senate/House of Representatives, not by executive action or retroactive rule making and will only add to the amount of inflation we are already enduring.   Remember the word, ""Transitory""?   Yeah, that one one lie that came from the inside and every department head started using.   A political toying of words to make it less negative.

Cancelling student loan debt is poorly targeted on a smaller fraction of the population. What about those people that were unable to attend college because they simply couldn't afford it.  They made that decision.   Not everyone gets to go to college!   You're not solving the cost of higher education.

I support broad-based student debt cancellation and urge the Biden Administration to use the Higher Education Act to provide debt relief to those who most need it. It is essential that debt relief provides at least up to $20,000 per borrower and that it is available to everyone who has federal student loans. Families are depending on the relief already proposed: over 26 million people have applied and 16 million have been approved.

Not only should there be broad-based relief for some, there should be income-based limitations given the current economic environment. Now that lives are extending, people that would naturally retire at younger ages now are staying much longer, which in turn, limits job growth (and, thus, income) for the rest. Now that the job progression is not at the levels that it once was, the payments that have been generally feasible in the past are not economically feasible now. There needs to be an income threshold or cap (like in SAVE) and also take into account other mandatory legal obligations like alimony and child support. 

Finally, there should be more relief under the Bankruptcy Code. The Brunner Test is antiquated and impossibly restrictive. Also the need to set up an adversarial procedure in Bankruptcy Court should also not be necessary since the debt is just like any other debt that a consumer owns. If it was so necessary for the government to save money, then like in any other contract, then the government should not have entered into the transaction. The government should not be allowed to manipulate the Bankruptcy Code to better benefit themselves vs. other debts owed.

I also urge the administration to enact this relief as quickly as possible to ensure millions of Americans can financially recover from the pandemic’s aftermath and have a healthier future. Swift action is needed as the pause on federal student loan interest and payments end on August 31, 2023. Restarting the student loan system without debt cancellation will make the student debt crisis worse.

I will start my life out in debt because none of the measures help me at all and the loan servicers refuse to apply any of the relief to me as I am ""not currently in payment"". In addition, I have paid off almost all my interest throughout my time having student loans. There is no relief possible for me because I was responsible and made sure my balance did not grow from its original amount. This seems inherently unfair to punish me for being financially responsible. I actually liked the refund possibility of the first plan that got struck down by the Supreme Court because it was fair to everyone. Someone who didn't pay their loans got relief. I would have gotten a refund of 4,000 based on the amount I had paid off, which I could have used to like apply to my car loan or something, which would help stimulate the economy. The relief program is not generally applicable and leaves out millions of Americans who are in college right now, trying to better themselves. These are the people who need help. They can't buy a house, car, and can barely make ends meet while in college or even after college because of starting in a whole from student debt. These are the people who NEED the relief to be able to thrive as citizens, not the people who have retained the debts for years. ","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,

The burden of student loan debt has become increasingly unsustainable for many Americans, often hindering their ability to achieve financial stability and contribute fully to the economy. It is disheartening to see individuals faithfully fulfilling their repayment obligations for decades only to find themselves trapped in a cycle where the principal balance remains stagnant or even increases due to accumulating interest.

Moreover, the traditional notion of a college degree as a ticket to career success is becoming outdated as employers increasingly prioritize skills and practical experience over formal education credentials. This shift in the job market further exacerbates the plight of long-term debtors who may not see a proportional return on their educational investment.

By offering student loan forgiveness to these individuals, the government would not only provide much-needed relief to struggling borrowers but also acknowledge the changing dynamics of the workforce. It would enable affected individuals to pursue opportunities that align better with their skills and aspirations, ultimately fostering greater economic mobility and productivity.

In conclusion, I urge the Department to consider the proposal for student loan forgiveness for long-term debtors as a crucial step towards addressing the student debt crisis and promoting equitable access to economic opportunities. Thank you for considering my input on this important matter.","Other",,,,,,

I did not take out student loans. Adults today are as guilty as their kids. There is usually no reason for kids to go out of state to get a good education. If kid get a student loan then they should be responsible for paying the debt.

   As a parent of four children who all went to university, we paid the majority portion of undergrad studies and we went into debt as a result.

I worked and went to college, living on $40K a year and still managed to make my payments.  Never went into forbearance and never missed a payment. I waited and waited for the POTUS to do what he said in 2021 and forgive student debt, in which I only had a little left by then, but it still would'be been nice to not have to pay it since I was religiously paying my debt and not waiting on others to use my tax dollars to pay everyone else's.  I paid my student loan off in early 2022 because I was tired of waiting on the POTUS to fulfill his campaign promise.  I made a lump sum payment to get rid of the payment.  But if the POTUS is now going to forgive debt, those individuals, like myself, who have paid like they are supposed to, waited for the ruling, and paid off their loan during this term, we should be re-imbursed.  It is not fair to use my tax dollars to pay others loans when I myself had a loan and did what I was supposed to. I was honest and paid my bills.  It took awhile, but I did it, with my degree.  I still do not make $120K a year so I should fall under this and have the last $20K refunded to me.  I would be happy to provide my information on my student loan payments!

It is NOT FAIR to people who have paid their debt, at any percentage, and to not receive a refund if they have paid off their loan in the last four years.  In fact, if other borrowers have not been paying their debt payments, they shouldn't get relief.  It is their responsibility and they signed the promissory note to pay back at any interest that was listed.  It is NOT my responsibility to pay it for them. ","Student",,,,,,

While there is a growing call for student loan forgiveness, it is important to consider the criteria for eligibility. While single adults making $100k may not be the first group that comes to mind when discussing student loan forgiveness, there are some valid reasons why they should be considered.

Firstly, the cost of living varies greatly depending on location. Someone earning $100k in a high-cost city may have a drastically different financial situation than someone earning the same amount in a more affordable area. Taking this into account, it is possible that some of these individuals may still be struggling to make ends meet, even with a relatively high salary.

Secondly, student loan forgiveness is not just about providing financial relief to those who are struggling, but also about addressing systemic inequalities in our education system. Even someone making $100k may have had to take out loans to pay for college, and forgiving those loans would help to level the playing field and provide greater opportunities for all students to succeed.

Finally, student loan forgiveness could have broader economic and social benefits, as it would free up funds that could be used for other purposes such as investing in retirement or starting a business. This, in turn, could lead to greater economic growth and job creation.

In summary, while single adults making $100k may not be the most obvious candidates for student loan forgiveness, there are valid reasons why they should be considered. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a fair and equitable system that helps all individuals to succeed, regardless of their financial situation.","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,

Many of us (parents and students) worked very hard to pay for our college education and the education of our children. The cancellation of student loan debt would be an insult to those of us who paid off our loans. The proposed loan forgiveness does nothing to reimburse us for working long hours, stretching out our schooling and giving up things we may have been able to afford if we had taken out a school loan. People must be held responsible for their personal economic choices. Erasing the debt does not teach students to manage their debt. Instead, it teaches them to overspend.

IT SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE.

While attending university for my bachelor's degree, I paid for half of my tuition out of pocket, while working three jobs to support myself during this time. The next half of my tuition was paid through student loans. My tuition costs and loan amounts were equal to about $30,000, however, after I graduated and interest was applied to the loans I received, I was looking at a bill closer to $50,000. I could not believe that a loan servicer would stand to make so much money off of a loan that I used to further my education and help me find a career. 

Now, I'm in grad school and looking at a loan bill of about $60,000 and that's not including interest. I have to pursue a master's degree due to my career field, healthcare/academia. I am a single mom whose ex husband will not pay child support, so money is always tight. 

I agree that students should be responsible to pay back loans that they secured to pay for their education, however, I do not think that the loan servicers should be allowed to charge interest on these loans. Additionally, student loan debt should not affect one's credit rating.

Pell Grants are a form of federal financial aid that are awarded to students with significant financial need, and are often seen as an indicator of the student's financial situation.

Forgiving student loans for those who received Pell Grants would have several benefits. Firstly, it would help to address the systemic inequalities that exist in our education system. Students from low-income families are more likely to receive Pell Grants and also more likely to struggle with loan repayment after graduation. Forgiving their loans would provide greater opportunities for these students to succeed and break the cycle of poverty.

Secondly, cancelling student loans for Pell Grant recipients would be a way to acknowledge the significant financial burden that these students face. Pell Grants often do not cover the full cost of tuition, and many students still need to take out loans to pay for their education. Forgiving these loans would help to ease the financial stress and provide some relief for these students and their families.

Finally, providing student loan forgiveness for Pell Grant recipients would not only benefit the individual borrowers but also have broader economic and social benefits. It would free up funds that could be used for other purposes such as investing in retirement, purchasing a home, or starting a business. This, in turn, could lead to greater economic growth and job creation.

If you would like to make a real difference in this dilemma, perhaps you should reconsider allowing individuals below the age of 21 from incurring debt in this fashion - that would have made more sense.  Or perhaps finance classes prior to signing these loans balancing the cost against their hope of future employment and the income said employment might generate.

Poor repayment to the citizens of this nation who have either not purchased what they couldn't afford or worked and repaid debt incurred.

Since 1980, the total cost to receive a four-year postsecondary credential has nearly tripled, even after accounting for inflation.

Comment: this has occurred due to the availability of federal funding, specifically student loans brokered via the Federal Government. 

Alternative solution: Cease all federal funding for student loans.

Sections 30.81 - 30.88.

Comment: A student loan is a binding contract between the lender ( the Federal Government via taxpayers) and the borrower. Choosing not to honor the terms ( the borrower ) is not a valid defense for not paying. Please note the numerous news articles indicating a great number of borrowers plan on splurging the forgiven funds. Again, choosing not to pay is not a valid defense.

Alternative solution: Treat the borrowers like the adults they claim to be; enforce the terms of the contract. Demand that the debt, which they signed for, is paid in full.",,,,,,,

While I do understand the national ramifications of allowing forgiveness to move forward, I ask that the American taxpayer extend the same courtesy we extend to other forms of burdensome government spending that DOESN'T directly help individual Americans.

People that seek higher education needs to do their due diligence to pursue a degree that will benefit them once they complete the credits. I went to college and got no assistance from the government. My wife, siblings and friends have pursued degrees with the assistance of FAFSA and/or student loans. We all have paid the loans without any assistance from government. A loan needs to be paid. By paying the student loans, we grow up to be responsible with our lives and finances. If only certain demographic receives some type of aid to repay what they willingly and voluntarily requested, the government needs to do the same for every student (no matter the circumstances). A loan is borrowing money. Key word borrowing. Does not matter if it is government funded or private. If I went to school (thanks to my service in the military, which was my choice) and did not acquire any student loans, why I have to suffer the consequences of poor judgment and decisions. I, as a veteran, see this as disrespectful because student loans forgiveness is discriminating against everyone else.

Students need to learn how to manage money. A good number of students use those loans and Grants for personal use and not for educational purposes. The government should make sure the students requesting Grants and loans are using those funds 100 percent for education; and not for personal gain before forgiving any loan amount. 

Instead of forgiving student loans, why the government does not forgive VA loans, assist homeless finding a place to live. There are many other good deeds that can be done, and this student loan forgiveness is not one of them.  ","Federal Agency",,,,,,

My husband and I put 4 children through college via student loans, parents loans and strict family budgeting.  We and our children all worked diligently to pay off the many student loans that we accumulated.  We took out the loans and understood it was our obligation to pay off that debt.  Now current and former students just quit paying their loans or pay very little and expect the government (America's taxpayers) to pick up the tab to have their loans forgiven.  This is so wrong and unfair to all the students and parents (like our family) who made paying those loans a priority.  We fulfilled our obligation.  

Why should we now have to pay off other's student loans?  Neither my husband or I have a college degree and it was very important to us to help our children get a college education. My husband and I both had fulltime jobs and worked hard to pay off the parent loans we had to take on.  Our children also paid off their student loans as quickly as possible after they graduated and started working.  We all took the loan obligations seriously and paid our debts.  Why should people who did not have the means or opportunity to get a college degree now have to pay for others?  Since there is often no income limit with these bailouts - lower income taxpayers are now paying off debt for much wealthier families.  They are also paying for people who got degrees that don't lead to good paying jobs, but we have to pay for their poor decisions?  How many people with student loans now have just decided not to pay their loans anymore, because they feel a future bailout will get them out of debt?  So wrong wrong wrong.  What if everyone just decided not to pay their home, auto and other loans anymore?  Disaster for our country.  Finally, why isn't the Biden administration looking into the ever increasing tuition that colleges are charging these days?  It's time that these colleges become part of the solution with increasing student debt.  STOP the bailouts and vote buying.  Many people are angry about having to pay for the debts of other people.

As a veteran, I'm embarrassed at what our nation has become under this president. This action is only a political decision made for him.

Your average college graduate earns $1,200,000 more than their peers without higher education. Even if they took out $200,000 in loans and paid them back over 20 years at 6%, they still come out almost one million dollars higher over the course of their life. Meanwhile, veterans who agreed to work a far more dangerous job for far less money are being left without the resources they need to live anywhere other than the street.

If you want to truly help younger college graduates, limit the options that lenders can offer for repayment. Many payment plans given to graduates are as close to interest-only as possible. We should also remove federal funding for non-STEM degrees and limit the amount a bank is allowed to loan a student pursuing a degree unlikely to result in employment comparative to the imminent cost of the loan repayment.

Our taxes should go to those who step up to fight to keep our country free, not someone who got a degree in not working and then subsequently being shocked that they're not employable. If we continue to not care for our veterans our military will need to resort to the draft just to deploy the national guard for domestic disasters. If you so desperately wish to throw money at college graduates in your transparent efforts to buy votes, add the quid pro quo that accepting repayment requires a four year enlistment the active military; at least then the money we're spending on these students will finally result in them having marketable talents they can finally turn into a paycheck.","Military",,,,,,

When I was 28 years old in 2003, I was looking for a sustainable wage job. I decided to visit the Wisconsin DWD and inquire about available jobs. The Wisconsin DWD  then offered me a few "" Skills assessment tests""  and after I completed the testing, they the Wisconsin DWD  asked me if I ever considered going to school to further my education. I asked how I was going to pay for it and they informed me that there were grants and other money available to get me started. I was excited to make these changes in my life. I enrolled into the local technical school, Madison College, formerly known as MATC in Madison, Wisconsin.  I did really well and made the Deans list numerous times during my tenure in school.  In 2004 I completed a few small Microsoft office skills certificates, and then in 2008 I completed a IT- Help Desk Technical Specialist certificate. After finishing the certificates I took a part time job at a local IT Help Desk position which I stayed employed at for 2 years and I enjoyed the work. Education is very important to me and I strive for more.  I wanted to seek a full time position, and I noticed that most of the IT jobs listed were ""Requiring"" an AAS degree. I then inquired on how I was going to pay for the classes, supplies, and other expenses. The school Bursar informed me of the PELL grant but failed to tell me that it would not be enough money to complete the degree.  I applied for the PELL grant and the Higher Education money. I enrolled into the AAS degree IT- Computer Systems Administration program. With the advice of school liaison counselors, and other professional workforce development advisors, I had to apply for some small loans in order to pay for the rest of  my degree program, supplies, and other expenses such as books and parking.  I was promised that completing my AAS degree would help ""Open doors"" for me and get me gainfully employed. In 2010, I graduated with honors, deans list recognition,  AAS - IT - Systems Admin 2 yr degree.  I then immediately started looking for employment only to be surprised that most "" White Collar""  higher wage positions were now ""Requiring"" a BS degree.  I wasn't very happy about it, after finishing the education that I have.   During  my time in school, my Father passed away  and I struggled with my personal life. But, I was able to complete the education that I worked hard on.  I know, I am not expecting this to sound like a sob story and for anyone to feel sorry for me.  I chose to enroll into college because it was my only viable option left to be successful in life. I thought that enrolling into a ""Liberal Arts"" program would be an easy transfer into a UW school. Little did I know, the UW school administration turned me away, because I do not have at least 3 semesters credits worth of a foreign language. I was bothered by that unknown issue, so I sought out a foreign language class and spent a semester trying to learn a foreign language, but at the age of 30+ my brain was not able to get the languages down.  I dropped out of the program and after some research,In 2011 I discovered another local accredited school named  Herzing University, they do not require a foreign language credit to enroll or complete a BS degree.  I then had to pay for the classes somehow since I was no longer working at the small IT Help desk job because I enrolled full time into school.  So, I then applied for more federal loans to pay for the education I was receiving. The first initial program that I enrolled into was a continuation of my IT studies in computer science. I started out strong in my classes, but I soon started to fail quickly due to the workload and the limited time to learn the material such as sub-nets and IP addressing schemes. I then took a short break and thought about my background working in Graphic arts in the 90's - 2000's. I then noticed that a lot of the Graphic Arts was being performed on  computers and that Graphic Artists were utilizing technology and I know about both careers. I then enrolled into a Graphic Design program offered through Herzing university. With the school administration questioning my career goals and how I figured out that the two career paths intersect, I explained that Graphic Artists use computers and should also have knowledge of the hardware / software troubleshooting. In 2013 I completed all of the required credits for the BS degree, graduating with honors and deans list recognition again.  Now, I had consulted with the school career counselor and they had me re write and re format my resume 35 times.  As if it was going to magically change into a better document.  Herzing University then changed its status from a For Profit school to a NON profit school as if they foreseen what we as former students  are dealing with now. 
I have tried  for over 11 years to find a company to hire me, without any success I have given up. I am now 50 yrs old and have my loans in IBR, and no job. ","Other",,,,,,

Clearing this debt could serve as an economic catalyst, alleviate financial burdens for many, address inequality, and rectify a genuine crisis. 

This is regarding the first and second points of the provision.

When a borrower's balance exceeds the original loan amount, it signals financial hardship, indicating an inability to effectively repay the loan. In such cases, the entire borrower debt should be forgiven, not just the interest.

Moreover, it appears that this provision applies only to those with balances exceeding the original amount at repayment. But what about borrowers who find themselves in this predicament after starting repayment? They too should be included, as they are also in need. In both scenarios, complete forgiveness of the loan amount is warranted.

If the provision solely addresses interest, then there should be no cap on the amount forgiven. It should encompass all accrued interest, past and present.

Additionally, if broad forgiveness is unattainable for all, we could consider setting the interest rate to 0% and waiving accumulated interest for ineligible borrowers. Opponents of forgiveness should find no issue with this, as it ensures repayment of the owed amount without forgiveness.

As someone burdened by student debt, I've experienced its significant impact firsthand. It hinders my ability to save for retirement, purchase a home, pursue passions, and causes constant stress and anxiety. This personal experience underscores the urgency for meaningful reform.",,,,,,,

Despite the latest efforts to forgive student loans, there are still some comments to think of. 

1.) Rather than forgiving loans that owe more than their original balance, what about those that have been bending backwards to make ends meets and pay their monthly amount, so interest does not capitalize?

2.) Something needs to be done regarding parent plus loans. Majority of parents take these loans out to ""pay"" for their child's school, although the child ends up paying it based off of their parents' income. Half of the parent plus loans are being paid by the child and they need help. 

3.) Go back to a 0""% interest rate. That was the most helpful thing in student loans. Despite these efforts, it is like everyone receiving forgiveness is not your average working 25-year-old that just graduated college. It is those that should have had forgiveness years ago but were failed by the education department. To make both sides happy, taxpayers/republican/democrats. Reinstate the zero interest. This way borrowers pay their loans and both sides can be happy. The zero interest helped people pay their loans off (and glad to do so) without the servicers bringing them down (as they do not help us) they tell us the wrong things on purpose; they lose our documents, they take months to get a reply, they take hours to get ahold off, they are not educated in student loans, and etc. 

4.)  The hardship forgiveness has not been detailed yet. However, it needs to be clear. Perhaps taking into consideration inflation, and how much a dollar is even worth now. My priority is housing and survival. Survival does include paying bills/loans however, a $600 monthly payment when you make 2,500 a month is not going to cut it when you have housing, other payments, and retirement. That is not feasible. i suggest a monthly payment cap.  ","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,

Tax payer funds should not be used to pay off debt of those that did not plan their finances or college educations appropriately. Had I known my student loan debt would be wiped out I would have gone to Yale too. 

We are just sending our daughter off to college next year and our son the year after that and they do not qualify for any financial aid. Since we don't make enough to pay for all of their college but yet we don't qualify for any aid, they will both have to take out loans and pay with funds they earned through their part time jobs. Paying off student loan debt is not going to help the next generation of college students. Instead of bailing out a few, help everyone afford college without going into mountains of debt. Decrease interest rates, hold all interest rates until after graduation, offer more pay for student work positions. Currently student work positions on campuses only pay $10-12 an hour. Fix the broken sytem instead of just patching it up for now.","Individual",,,,,,

I'm an individual Taxpayer, I am one of the millions of innocent people that you are going to burden with unnecessary debt because of the transfer of someone's PERSONAL education loan to others like me.

My three children attended college in the 2000s (along with my wife), during those college years, we racked up tens of thousands of dollars of debt along with tens of thousands of dollars of cash outlays to pay for college. I wasn't able to claim ANY of those expenses or interest payments on my taxes as a credit or deduction and I never made even $200K. I paid off a ParentPlus loan of $20K in less than 7 years. It seems so foolish and frustrating now. My own government tells me I was stupid to do the right thing. If you want to make it right, go back and allow people to claim their estimated educational expenses as a credit or deduction 

I could support a plan that might allow someone to declare bankruptcy on their loans, so that they incur a financial penalty for their actions (like a bankruptcy on their record) - maybe a limited action, to declare bankruptcy on the interest, but they have to pay off the principal. Maybe an action that requires the schools to repay part of the people's losses. If the student is allowed to walk away from their loan debt, they should lose their degree. Have the school rescind the degree so that they don't get to use the degree to obtain a job. They'll have the education, but the result would be as if they walked away from college 1 credit short or failed to pay their last semester. There should be a dramatic loss for the student.

Obviously, the student loan programs are failures. It's time to admit it and end them. If Taxpayers are picking up the bill from the failures of the program, then it cannot work. Stop issuing federal student loans and return control of education to the states, local governments, and the people themselves. Follow the 10th Amendment.

I am working 60-hour weeks and paying out 50% of my current take home income to try and escape this nightmare. If I understand this proposal the way it is written. I may not have chance at any amount of forgiveness. I am happy to finally be financially able to make significant progress in repayment, but this comes after having been denied a loan on a mortgage and a chance to be a homeowner.

I am a 40-year-old man with no wife, no children, no home, simply because I have been drowning under student loan debt for the last 14 years.

Whom have balances that are 50% more than what they started with, but do not count as ""unpaid"" interest because we enrolled into a loan program like REPAY and others like it that were offered.

I am someone who is working towards PSLF. I wish part of this proposal included partial loan forgiveness for PSLF without any kind of cap on the income you make.

Example scenario: You have completed 85% of your PSLF time. Your parent then develops health issues requiring you to relocate to help take care of them. You are unable to find a PSLF qualifying job, when you relocate. You should be able to apply for PSLF and get 85% of the loan forgiven. This would help tremendously to lower the student loan burden and not feel like you have to choose student debt over providing medical care for an ill parent.

The Biden administration is well aware that people that never borrowed any money from the government, and the people that took out loans and paid them back, far outnumber the few that refuse to pay, yet they continue to push this unfavorable and ILLEGAL loan forgiveness.

The clock is ticking and Biden only has a few more months to STOP THE MADNESS and give up this futile effort to forgive student loans.

I believe that this plan will help many people who are struggling and have struggled for decades to repay their loans. 

We are a middle-class family who are lucky to have 3 hardworking high-school children who would love attend college and pursue their dreams, 1 wants to be a teacher, 1 a nurse and the 3rd is ""not sure yet"" but love computers and math.  We can't afford to send them college.  As you are aware the ""new"" FAFSA does not take into multiple children, so our SAI (Student AID Index) is $25,000 a YEAR PER Child.  

Our only option is taking the dreaded Parent PLUS loans this fall which brings the point of my comment:

  We still have our own student loan debt.  The proposed regulations (specifically Proposed § 30.83(a)(1)) would forgive the remaining debt we have.  Our LAST date of entering repayment on our UNDERGRAD only loans being June of 2003. This loan and numerous others reaching as far back as 1995 were consolidated in November 2023 to qualify for the new SAVE plan.  According to the draft, ""For consolidation loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2023, we propose to instead use the latest date that any loan repaid by the consolidation ended its initial grace period, or in the case of a PLUS loan was disbursed.""

What will be the impact of any proposed forgiveness (of Undergraduate loans from the 90's up to your prosed date of July 2005) when we originate our 1st (but unfortunately won't be our last) Parent PLUS loan in September of this year?  Of course, we understand that the future Parent Plus loans we will take out are fully and legitimately excluded from this forgiveness proposal, but we wanted to clarify that we have hope of forgiveness of our own Student loan debt without resetting the clock or extending forgiveness from the 20 years we qualify for in this proposal to 25 years because our children start college in the fall of this year.  

We appreciate your efforts in this endeavor to help ease the burden so many of us have had for over a quarter-century.  We understand we will be in student loan debt until past retirement age, but our kids and everyone's kids may never have this burden because the new plans.

Thank you for your time.

Making loan forgiveness contingent on military service would be an excellent way to beef up our military ranks and an opportunity for these freeloaders to show their gratitude to the American people who are picking up the tab on their debt.  Individuals older than 40 can serve in the Peace Corps or AmeriCorps 

I oppose student loan forgiveness. There is a fundamental unfairness of doing such a thing - especially to the millions of Americans who have paid their college debts, and sacrificed much to do so. Forgiving student debt would send a terrible message to the very same universities that already gouge their customers with sky-high tuition. Tuition will never come back to earth, if we bail out those who borrowed more than they could repay.

My name is Cynthia Brooks. I would like to see my Student Loan balance relieved. I am 53 years old. I graduated in 2009 and have paid about $22,000 on my balance. However, because of the interest, the balance barely changes and I still owe $53,000.
I am trying to plan my future and retirement and am afraid I will be saddled with this debt until I die. I will not be able to afford Student Loan payments and Healthcare Insurance. Yes, it was my choice to go to school and obtain a degree, but I was kind of forced into it. My ex-husband wanted his freedom and in order to keep a house and support my 4 children and myself, I needed to go to school to get a degree and get a better paying job. I did not realize the interest was so ridiculous and would end up haunting me for so long. I currently work for a non-profit so will be eligible for the Public Service relief program eventually. I have 86 payments that qualify for the forgiveness. It would be such a great relief for that to happen sooner rather than later so I can focus on contributing more to my 401K and paying off my house in order to retire by the time I am 67. Thank you.

I am hopeful to get some relief on my loans, and think that it also needs to be looked at the interest that is charged for future generations and have some oversight on the costs associated with school. As it is not the tuition but all of the tacked on fees that you pay for and the overly priced books. There should be a legislation that schools have to be more transparent on fees and have new students take mandatory class to understand the fees as well as employment salary ranges versus cost. 

Additionally, I am in the PSLF program and have three years left to go, I have worked hard and cannot wait for it to be forgiven but I feel as though 10 years is so long to do so it should be based on hours worked as many in the healthcare industry work a crazy amount of hours and should be rewarded for this. In addition having give backs into the community to be able to work off it in a community service way would be nice as well. Its sad and unlikely they will get forgiven and not tied up in litigation but something must be done. 

Please at the very least remove the interest for the loans and take away the max salary to be 125K as it is the amount you need to survive in some cities as I live in Los Angeles so it does not get you very far. ","Financial Aid Administrator",,,,,,

It was not paid by a President who created one of the largest increases in inflation looking to buy votes

But as stated I understood it was the agreement I made.  This is one of the ways I learned to be responsible for the choices I made.  

Why should a person who never went for a college education be expected to pay back the money borrowed by those who did.  Should the union worker who went through an apprenticeship program be expected to pay for the loans a Philosophy major incurred?  The answer to that question should be NO!

Forgiving loans does not mean the money is not paid back.  it means that hard working, RESPONSIBLE, tax payers will pay it back for generations in the form of interest on US Debt that is unnecessary.

Stop this insanity.  If you took the loan pay it back.  QUIT trying to buy votes.",,,,,,,

I am 68 years old and my current loan will be paid in 2049. The chances of me living that long are slim to none. That translates to the only forgiveness available upon my death.

Additionally, it puzzles me that the income to determine paying back the loan is driven by my income and my spouse's income which is ridiculous. She is the step-mother to my children and due to the income we have together there are no plans for forgiveness and she works for the Veterans Hospital. Why can't her years of service count towards forgiveness if we must include her income to determine loan payments. It makes no sense and really is unfair. The entire financial issue should be based on me alone and NO filing federal taxes separately makes no sense as we currently file jointly married. Additionally I worked 37 years in Public Education and have been retired since 2014. That does not help a forgiveness issue being retired. 

So my concern is that we are overlooked as are many retired couples. Perhaps if you want us to continue to pay the Parent Plus loan the interest rate that we pay can be reduced to half of what we are paying currently if the loan has no chance of forgiveness until death of me. Thank you.

If you have the fortitude to pursue higher education, you should also have the resolve to repay any loans acquired.

Not everyone should attend college, but for everyone who does, they should be expected to pay for that education.  With conservative spending habits, it is possible to pay back loans either while attending college or immediately after.  I am currently attending classes to obtain an M.B.A.  I have paid for most of my classes while attending and only had to take out a small loan for the final year of classes.  I currently pay my loan/interest monthly and will have it paid in full shortly after I graduate in December.  It is MY responsibility.  I decided to pursue this degree; therefore, I am the one who will complete it including not just the schoolwork, but also the loan repayment.  It is not my neighbors' responsibility.  Not my friends' responsibility.  Not my family's responsibility.  Our taxes should not benefit one person over another.  Why do my taxes go towards paying someone else's student loan?

I graduated in 2009 and I have paid those loans back, both with assistance from family as well as through working after graduation. I attended law school from 2012 to 2015, passed the bar, and am currently working as an attorney helping employees in California who have been subject to discrimination, harassment, retaliation, non-payment of wages, etc. I love my job and I love helping people. Unfortunately, attending law school meant that I had to take graduate school loans totaling at least $200,000 as I could not afford the tuition out of pocket. While I make a good salary now, with the high cost of living in California where I am licensed to practice, my student loan obligations are still in excess of $800 per month on an income based repayment plan, in part, due to the over $80,000 in capitalized interest on my original loans. I have paid my loans and have no problem repaying the amount I borrowed to attend school, but due to the runaway interest, even a reduced payment on an income based repayment plan creates a heavy burden on my family's budget, which is true for many individuals of my generation. I have been paying student loans, whether for undergraduate or graduate school, since 2009 and have never been in default. However, due to this, my ability to purchase a house was impacted and delayed and my wife and I have put off having children due to the financial strain these payments have. I believe that these new regulations, which are the direct result of legal challenges to previous efforts to assist struggling Americans, while not enough, are at least a step in the right direction to helping millions of struggling people work their way out of the heavy financial burden that has been imposed on them due to runaway interest and unmanageable student debt.

Will someone like me receive any credit for paying off over 15,000 in interest? This amount of money would have made a significant difference in my life at this point, as I still am not able to own a car or home. I wouldn't have made extra payments if it wasn't necessary to eventually stop the principal for ballooning further.","Principal",,,,,,

I have 17.5 years of service and have dedicated countless days/weeks/ and years to serving my country. Why can we not trade student loan relief for 6 years of mandatory service? Of my 17+ years, I have 70k in student loan debt that, with my last contract I was able to get Student Loan Repayment Program as an incentive. This program is not effective and does not provide much help! I get a payment one time a year, usually six to nine months late while interest piles up on my account. It is a constant fight every year to get a payment made let alone, the amount of paperwork to submit, on top of the interest I accrue on my loan. With my countless years of service, I have always been in good standing and yet, struggled to get funding through FTA and other scholarship programs. Why is there even interest accrued? IF you want to help, stop with the interest. Make programs that actually work and do more government incentives for businesses to help their employees pay down their debt. Pay your military more and help with recruiting incentives. These people are the one going to battle for you, go to battle for them and their families. No one is ahead in this economy with inflation, yet nothing is done to help. ","Military",,,,,,

This exponentially affects those borrowers on income-driven payment plans where interest is only paid and, with rising rates, can effectively cause the loan to go further underwater.  

In the long run I believe it is critical to completely rethink the funding process of these loans and not treat them as superfluous but rather as critical in nature where no interest is charged and, at most, a minimal, flat administrative charge is implemented within the initial terms of the loan and persisted the life of the loan term.

The amount they are in debt is unacceptable for most graduates.  Unless it is for a doctor, lawyer, health care worker, they have no chance basically to even use their degree.  When my son graduated in 2010, he was told he qualified for, well the technical name for it has temporarily left me, but it was fo thru FASFA, I think, one of those scholarships, however when he went back to high school to get his report card, he was told, oh no, he did not qualify for it, on account of 3/10th of 1 percent.  After investigating this further, come to find out, during the last few weeks of school, he was out 8 days because of flu going around, and when he got back, he tried in one particular class to get his make up work,  His teacher was also a coach, well  instead of teaching, he had a substitute, My son asked him numerous time for the make up work and the sub told him, not to worry about it, he was gonna graduate.  Well, that cost him the scholarship, I reached out to the principal to no avail, he backed up the sub.  Well, I had already promised my son that he will go to college.  So he got all the financial aid that he possibly could get.  I promised him that he could go, so I have been living up to my promise and making all the payments.  Its only fair.  So I think  for all the misguided people out there, they should be awarded forgiveness. And by the way, I also the Mr. Biden is an excellent President, he inherited a terrible mess.  It seems the more Americans ask for, he and the administration seem to do all they can to deliver.  He has done a great job, I do not know what has gotten into the way so many Americans think nowadays (no, strike that) I DO know what has gotten into Americans heads nowadays, and I sure thought they had better sense,  I hope they all start understanding soon.

I would like to make a comment about the student loans forgiveness. I don't think we need to forgive the student loans as much as set a limit for the interest rate on the student loans.  If the interest rate would be no more than 1-3% fixed, then anyone who took/takes a loan to pay for their college could afford to repay the loan.  But when the loan providers can make the interest rate flexible, the borrower cannot afford to repay the loan with the changing monthly payment along with other monthly bills they have. 

Reduce the interest rates on student loans and borrows could finally see an end in sight and have their loan paid off.   ","Individual",,,,,,

I pay over $2,000 in rent, $400 for my ""budget"" car, and about $1,500 on my student loans -- every single month. I cannot possibly afford a decent house within an hour of my city. I don't personally know anyone who could.

I have about $100,000 in student loans total. That's after paying in-state tuition at a public university and paying no tuition at all in law school. Many of my colleagues, including some who are approaching their forties and even fifties, have much larger student debts than mine. That's primarily because of a badly inflated cost of education, but it's also because of interest. I personally have some loans with over 7% interest. It will take me until the latter half of my life to pay them off -- assuming no medical problems, no major life changes, and perfect economic conditions. Most of my monthly payments go towards interest; I barely touch the principal. Interest rates make student loans effectively permanent. Except for mortgages and student loans, we do not allow debt to shackle people this way. And at least mortgages come with a home.

I find Section 30.81's cutoff of $120,000 entirely reasonable. I wish it were even higher, but it at least demonstrates an awareness by the administration that student loans don't just hurt America's poor. Student loans hamper this nation's middle class and have all but eliminated my generation's dreams of home ownership and financial comfort. This nation cannot continue to fail its young people by allowing them to fall into the vicious cycle of interest repayment. Section 30.81 would alleviate that pressure and allow educated Americans to start building their lives on a solid foundation.

Critics have complained that this new rule will unfairly extend forgiveness to some but not others. This rings hollow. Section 30.83 will ensure that everyone, not just young borrowers, will benefit. Sections 30.86 and 30.87 will protect victims of failed institutions. It doesn't solve the problem caused by student loans, but this new rule will help Americans move on with their lives. It's not much, and it's terribly late -- but it's something. I support this proposed rule without reservation.","Individual",,,,,,

I only borrowed a fraction of the balance I currently owe. Most of my current balance is accumulated interest.  The accumulation of interest has been aggravated by the fact that I experienced two bankruptcies. My first bankruptcy was in 1999 and I was in technical default on my loans for three years.  The second bankruptcy was in 2009 and I was in technical default on my loans for five years. I also lost a home in 2006 due to a bad relocation to Massachusetts after I lost my job in Michigan. I couldn't sell the home due to recession that hit the rest of the country in 2008-2009. Throughout both of the bankruptcies interest accumulated, and I likely accumulated more interest than the relief I received through those bankruptcies. Bankruptcy should have provided me a new start but all it did was delay the inevitable. By lawyer in the 2nd bankruptcy refused to start an adversarial hearing saying they never work, and he felt they were abusive to the system. In between the Bankruptcies and since the last one discharged, I haven't made the kind of money I needed to make payments and support me and my partner, who is disabled and unable to work, with a reasonable standard of living which includes owning a home. We live in a high-cost housing region. It took me from 2014, when the 2009 bankruptcy was discharged until 2020 to be able to find an affordable home to purchase. We ended up purchasing a HUD Home that required significant renovation. I feel that I'll never be able to retire. I feel that retirement will result in poverty.  I'm a veteran who served from 1982-1986 and we have a piss-poor ""GI Bill"" which didn't provide for us like was provided for veterans before and after I served. I think Senior Citizens and Veterans should have loans discharged especially after so many years.  I'm also worried I will not benefit from any new programs because I usually make under the 120,000 a year but had to pull money from my 401k to pay off runaway debt which put me over that amount.  However, this isn't new earnings this was money pulled from retirement to survive my high cost of living. I will continue to take forbearances as long as I can. Eventually, either I'll need to start paying, based upon lower earnings during retirement or hopefully, I'll pay very little because Social Security isn't considered income calculated for repayment. Eventually, I may have to choose default over housing, food, and medical costs which are anticipated to increase as I age. I'm afraid for my future. I feel betrayed by the bankruptcy system and the veteran's administration. I shouldn't owe anywhere near my balance of $240,000. Most is accumulated interest.","Financial Aid Administrator",,,,,,

No federal loans were ever used.

The premise of runaway college costs requiring ever greater college loan programs and forgiveness is perhaps faulty.  Easy Federal college loans and grants are a likely cause factor in driving college costs higher.  The stated tripling of educational costs after accounting for inflation since 1980 is strongly correlated to the proliferation of easy federal money.  This forgiveness, should it occur, will directly result in not eligible people seeking their relief, as well as increasing educational demand.  This additional demand will inevitably raise higher education costs furthur. 

Unilaterally changing terms and conditions to a legal agreement is not appropriate.  If congress desired the proposed conditions they would have had it written into law.  In fact, educational loans were not subject to bankruptacy rules to assure congress ant the taxpayer lenders the agreed on loan would be repaid.  In my opinion the proposed waiving requirements are arbitrary and are poorly developed as to their rational.

The estimated costs of this rule making is in excess of $145 Billion dollars.  Surely this amount requires congressional approval and not administrative action.  In my estimation, it is an egredious overstep of spending authority.

My family will be directly affected if these rules are approved as the contracted loans costs, or future loan repayments to the federal budget will be shifted from the signed legal agreement to us as the taxpayers.  

As a recommendation, the Department of Education should consider to seek to recover costs from private educational institutions if their product did not support the borrowers expectation.

Respectfully submitted.","Federal Agency",,,,,,

I think the Department needs to count payments made during default period toward PSLF. Maybe it does not need to be counted in every instance. However, it seems to be the President's goal to target assistance toward those in tough socio-economic positions. Therefore, I suggest the Department count default period payments (ie loan rehabilitation) toward forgiveness. If someone has received Pell Grants/works for a nonprofit or governmental agency, the chances of defaulting on student loans is higher. Also, there is the chance that an individual made payments toward student loans, but forgot about the existence of one loan, or didn't make the minimum payment. 

Including default periods (or at a minimum loan rehabilitation payments) toward the PSLF count will provide much needed relief to those who sacrificed a larger paycheck to give back to their community/country.

See section ""Add § 30.81 specifying the Secretary's authority to provide a one-time waiver of the amount by which the borrower's current loan has an outstanding principal balance exceeding the amount owed when the loan first entered repayment if they are enrolled in an IDR plan and their income is less than or equal to $120,000 if the borrower's filing status is single or married filing separately; $180,000 if the borrower's filing status is head of household; or $240,000 if their tax filing status is married filing jointly or qualifying surviving spouse.""
I make less than 120K but I'm only 17 years removed from my undergraduate degree, not 20 years. As this is is proposed as a one time waiver, there is an inherent unfairness for those close to that date but not quite there. I would like the Department of Education to consider either a tiered or partial forgiveness program Or the Department of Education should consider making this a rolling 20 year date. 

Additionally, the DoE should consider making changes to (counting past payments, forgiving debt, etc) for people who have been using the Extended Repayment Plan (25 years). I have not heard any program yet addressing or benefiting those who have been making payments under that repayment plan. I would think that those in the Extended Repayment Plan have the highest debt and will have it for a long time. I recently explored switching payment plans to the SAVE plan, but my payment would still increase more than I can afford, which means I can't access the shorter repayment time. ","Individual",,,,,,

The burden of student loans has become an insurmountable barrier to financial stability and upward mobility for millions of Americans. The escalating cost of higher education has far outpaced wage growth, leaving individuals and families drowning in debt before they even enter the workforce. I see this all the time when I am helping individuals with debt management strategies to help them save more money.

According to data from the Federal Reserve, outstanding student loan debt in the United States has surpassed $1.7 trillion, with over 45 million borrowers affected. This staggering figure not only weighs heavily on individuals but also stifles economic growth and innovation.

It's evident that higher education is no longer a luxury but a necessity for securing decent employment and competing in today's job market. However, the exorbitant cost of tuition, coupled with rising living expenses, has forced students and families to take on crippling levels of debt just to pursue their dreams of a better future.

Moreover, the economic repercussions of this debt crisis are profound. Many graduates are delaying major life milestones such as buying homes, starting families, or saving for retirement because they are shackled by monthly loan payments. This not only hampers individual financial well-being but also undermines broader economic stability and growth.

By implementing meaningful student loan debt relief measures, we can alleviate this burden and unleash the full potential of millions of Americans. Relief programs would inject much-needed liquidity into the economy, as individuals would have more disposable income to spend on goods and services, thereby stimulating demand and job creation.

Furthermore, studies have shown that reducing student debt can have positive ripple effects across various sectors. For instance, a report by the Roosevelt Institute estimated that cancelling student debt would boost GDP by up to $108 billion per year and create over 1 million new jobs annually.

In light of these compelling arguments and the urgent need for action, I urge policymakers to prioritize student loan debt relief legislation. It's not just a matter of economic fairness; it's an investment in the future prosperity of our nation.

Thank you for considering my input on this critical issue.","Other",,,,,,

2) I still believe the Secretary should be able to waive a part of the balance of student loans if it shows that a student has taken out more loans than 50% of what their income is. If they have $20,000 in student loans and only make $25,000 or $30,000 a year, that doesn't account for their living expenses.

Our Federal budget can't take the hit, nor should it.  We have so many other things we should be worried about financing than paying for an individuals education loan, that they opted to take out.

I wholly support this proposal.
Here is a summary of my story.  I took out loans for undergraduate college and then law school and graduated in 1987.  I began repayment in 1988 with a principal balance of around $28,000.  In the early nineties I encountered financial difficulties and entered a period of non-payment.  In the mid 2000's or so I entered repayment. By that time, however, the principal balance on my account had ballooned to $56000 or so.  That original $28,000 obligation has now ballooned to over $235,000.00.  I am now in my early sixties and am in the government's SAVE repayment program for which I am grateful. I expect that without some substantial relief I and others like me will be burdened by ballooning debt the rest of our lives.  This is utterly unfair when the US has regularly bailed out big banks, airlines, big corporations, and forgives PPP loans without substantial documentation.
Again, I wholly support this proposal and ask that the program include payments going back to the original maturity date of the student loans.
Thank you for your consideration.

What about the people who inspire to go to school but cannot afford it are now seeing all these loans being forgiven and having to pay for it in taxes. It's seeming like a punishment to those who didn't take out thousands of dollars in loans and not pay them. 

This is allowing people to feel intitled. To think they can borrow money that they cannot afford to pay back because bad behavior is being forgiven. And it's NOT FORGIVEN!!! It's being passed down in many ways, higher taxes, high cost of goods, higher tuition costs.

Background: mother of two young children in over $250k of debt from graduate school. Husband has $250k. Both parents working. 

Fear and foremost, I pursued higher education to be able to have a stable life and opportunities to achieve the American dream. I continue to be frustrated by politicians remarks that people who went to Ivy League schools don’t deserve relief. Having earned the opportunity of admission at an Ivy League institution and not having financial family means to support myself I took out loans. My story is not unique. Many students when offered this life-changing opportunity—take it and find a way to finance it typically through loans. I  didn’t take out as much as my balance reflects however  the exorbitant interests and the curious parameters for deciding who qualifies for relief has continued to make it impossible to pay.

I’m enrolled in the SAVE plan which is offering my family little relief. My husband owes $600 each month and I owe $1000. We live in a large metropolitan city that gives us the best opportunity to try to make ends met and provide for our young family. However, $1600 in student loan payments is the equivalent of full time daycare for one  child. If I don’t prioritize childcare, I have no hope at earning the money to pay back my loan. And truthfully, our family cannot afford both. We’ve been supplementing with now maxed out credit cards. 

Bottom line: Despite my husband and I both working extremely hard, there’s no way we can make this modified SAVE payment and we find ourselves wondering why our unique financial situation  and city/state cost of living isn’t a consideration. Should someone living in a high cost of living state be expected to pay the same as someone in a low cost of living state? Did you know that in LA the poverty level is considered 100k and 200k with 2 kids is barely middle class? It seems like the administration is stuck on these “traditional” indicators of wealth that just don’t like up with the times.  

1) please consider a more dynamic approach to evaluating who qualifies for relief.
2) please consider adjusting interest rates and recalculating accrued interest accordingly.

Joe,

 You are a fool that is putting this country so far in debt it will never come out of it.  You will be long gone by then, so why you should care.

I couldn't afford to go to college but made a good life for myself and my family. 

Your irresponsible choice to try and expunge someone's college debt is so wrong in so many ways.  If you could see in the future when you were a younger man, you would be ashamed of yourself.  But you're just a puppet on drugs now that have so many in control of your every tough and move that you make.

So, you want my opinion, if they took out the loan, they need to pay it back.
Why do I have to pay back my SBA loan that I had to take out to keep my business alive during the so called epidemic?  I took it out to better myself and my business. This is the same as a student taking out a loan to try and better themselves too!

Why can't you see this you are bumbling old man!

I am an individual who obtained a professional degree and graduated in 2015.  My degree is in a field in which debt far surpasses our earning potential within the first several years of employment.  My loans accrued a large amount of interest during the time I was earning my degree, and has been ever since.  I made a large payment to clear my interest in an attempt to start seeing my balance go down, as every month I was making my required payments, but rather then seeing my balance decrease, it continued to increase.

I realize that I took on the decision and responsibility of the financial burden to further my education to be able to work in a field that I have great interest in, but if I had it to do over again, my choice may have been different.  I have been following the discussions since the time of COVID and the start of this administration, and I am very saddened and disappointed in what many feel is a disproportionate application of relief.  The choices made and put into place are targeting select groups (including but not limited to: minorities, individuals with disabilities, individuals who did not need to take out maximal amounts of loans due to family assistance, those working in public service fields, etc.), and seeing many others that can benefit from assistance just as much, if not more in some cases, and not being included.

One of the biggest issues that has been presented by people who have paid off previous loans (and I feel the same), feel that they will have been sleighted - I agree with this sentiment, and no, I am not one of those people.  These people have put in the time, work, and finances to pay their debt, albeit a generally much smaller debt (degrees obtained 25+ years ago).  One of the biggest differences, apart from the growing tuition costs, is the application of outlandish interest rates. These make it near impossible for people coming from modest backgrounds to make a dent in their debt and feel like they are making any progress.

I am happy to pay my debt, but the debt I borrowed to obtain my degree, not the additional tens of thousands of dollars that have been tacked on due to interest.  As much as I would love full loan forgiveness, I would feel a fairness and accomplishment if the interest on federal student loans are erased, and I am only responsible for paying back on the initial amount I borrowed.  At this time, I would not even benefit from the current proposal of clearing any interest that brought balances higher than initial borrowed amounts as I have already paid that, and then some, to feel a sense of progress when I make my payments monthly.

I feel there should be some forgiveness for all, rather than full, or close to full, forgiveness for some.  We are all struggling at this time, and the resumption of student loan payments has placed a burden on me, as well as most Americans in the same situation.  Due to my degree, I worked all through COVID, on-site and at risk compared to people who worked from home, or did not have to work for some time, but still received some income.  I am in the medical field, and no, I am not an MD.  I have also read where there has been proposals to forgive tuition for nurses and other essential personnel, however my profession was not included in that designation, and we were and still are essential.  Again, some assistance for some, or no assistance for any.

Please take these thoughts into consideration with all those that you receive, and know that education, though not a right, is important for the growth and progression of our society and the less attainable it becomes, the more our society will decline or stagnate.

When I graduated I had over $60k in student loan debt to repay. At the time of my graduation, I was also paying for two houses, making a car payment each month, and had general living expenses such as utilities, food, and medicine. It took me about 10 years to pay all my student loans, with many sacrifices made during those years of not going out to eat, never taking vacations and giving up other things that I considered a luxury, such as purchasing a newer vehicle, so that I could do what I had promised to do when I signed my loan documents and received money to pay for my degree. 
 
When I made the decision to attend college, I made sure that the degree I was seeking would help me increase my future salary potential so that I could repay my student loans. At the time of graduation, I also owed the college about $3k, directly, and they would not give me my actual diploma until I had paid them in full, which took a year. I take pride in the fact that I was willing to sacrifice and keep my written promise and pay my loans off years before they were due to be paid in full. Each month I paid more than my minimum amount due so that I could pay them off sooner and reduce the total amount of interest paid. I had both subsidized and unsubsidized loans. During Covid, when the Federal Government made the decision to pause student loan payments and stop all interest, I continued to make my payments every month, still sacrificing things I would have enjoyed doing but did not do, just so I could repay my debt, again, as I promised to do when I signed my loan documents.

Regarding Mr. Biden's decision to forgive any student loan debt I would like to state, unequivocally, that this is entirely unfair to the people that have never attended college, or to those individuals like me who did attend college and have paid our debt in full. If he really wants to help people, do something to reduce the increasing cost of obtaining a college degree or find a way to help everyone, not just a specific group of people, and during an election year. Work with charge card companies to set limits on the amount of interest they can charge in a month, or do something to bring down inflation, two things that help more people than just those who attended college. 
I believe this practice of forgiving debt will also teach the younger generation of students that it's okay not to pay their debts, which will in turn cause future years of foreclosures on homes and people filing for bankruptcy, just to get out of what they legally agreed to do when they signed their name on a piece of paper obligating them to repay the company or institution that gave them the loan.  If you do not make your car payment, the loan company will repossess your vehicle. If you do not make your mortgage payments, the loan company will foreclose on your home. If we are going to forgive someone their student loan debt, then take away the piece of paper that says they have a degree and have the college or university note on their file that they did not complete their degree. Why should these students be able to reap the benefits of having the degree without paying the cost of receiving it?

Mr. Biden states that by forgiving student loans, it will help boost the economy. If student loans become forgiven, I would like at least a portion of my mortgage, credit card balance, or any other loan in my name to be forgiven so I can then go out and spend my money on something else, which will also boost the economy. Or give me a check for the same amount that will be forgiven for graduates today, because I paid my loans and should now be shown the same courtesy. I would like the amount of the check to be tax-free, also. 

Please use common sense and stop the plan to forgive any type of student loan debt. Since student loan debt is excluded from standard chapter 7 and 13 bankruptcy proceedings, why should it be forgiven at all? If people find it impossible to repay their student loan, they can file for bankruptcy on this debt by filing a separate bankruptcy by showing undue hardship on them and their dependents. Isn't undue hardship one of the main reasons why Mr. Biden feels student loans should be forgiven? If so, let those borrowers file for bankruptcy just like anyone else would have to do to legally be relieved of repaying any debt.

Thank you for your time in reading my comments.

As a person who borrowed money to go to school, then get my wages garnished when I was late on a couple of payments but was consistent in paying my loan back, I feel anyone who signs a document promising to pay back, should pay back.

I was a Dean's Listed undergraduate honor student in two programs, English and Psychology, pre-law, in my senior year, when my Dad passed away. I'd won a Regents Scholarship and a Pell Grant to go to Hunter College, CUNY (then a prestigious non-open admissions institution), and had dreams of going to Harvard Law, but the money wasn't enough to pay for my out-of-city tuition, books, lab fees, and transportation and MI&E from Long Island to New York City and back every day, so I'd taken student loans so as not to put any further burden on my ailing father, who was the family's sole breadwinner, and already working two jobs to feed and house and clothe his family. When he passed away, God rest his good soul, I (as the eldest of three) had to leave school and help my widowed mother to support our family. It took me ten years to get back to college, working full-time and attending school at night, to earn the last few credits of my B.A., and 13 more years of doing so (on student loans) to earn my M.A. and Ph.D.

My family was far from affluent, before or after Dad's passing, since he had suffered 9 hernias and four heart-attacks, as well as cataracts, and an arterial bypass, in the years prior to his death. I continued to work full-time, and once I had my M.A., taught college at night professionally, even after my marriage and while raising a stepson with ADHD. 

I paid my student loans off at 62 with no forgiveness or assistance from anyone--and I never earned the kind of money that they implicitly promised. Even then, I used my life's savings to do so, because the interest rates that SLMA was then charging were so high that the low interest rate on my savings couldn't possibly offset them.

I don't see why young people who knowingly agreed--with their parents' assent--to take on student loan debt under the terms offered them; used the money for whatever purposes it went to; and are now being asked to pay the piper should be allowed to ignore their obligations as they have been doing for decades. When I paid off my undergraduate loan, there was a banner headline in the _NY Newsday_ lamenting that more than 10,000 other students had not paid back a cent--and SLMA had the effrontery to try to bill me a late charge on top of that (when I'd never been late on any payment)! 

If President Biden takes pity on the poor darlings who want to shirk their obligations, he needs to make restitution in kind to those of us who were responsible enough to discharge their student loan obligations, regardless of the kinds of hardship I described. I gave my country back over 30 years of teaching as an adjunct professor in various colleges and universities, and was given no quarter. Why should someone who treated his or her obligations as a joke be rewarded with relief, when people like me received none?

I urge Congress to defeat this proposed legislation, not for political reasons, but for reasons of equity and fairness to the millions of students to whom such coddling was not offered.

As a lifelong Republican with student loans, I support these changes, especially the elimination of up to $20,000 in interest above the original loan amount.  I would suggest that this be increased to eliminate all interest that has accrued since the loans were disbursed.  Personally, my original loan balance was approximately $90,000.  It is now almost $120,000 because of deferment and trouble finding a full-time job.  I would be in support of eliminating all of the interest and hope this can be altered.  Otherwise, please continue with changes that help student borrowers like me.  We are truly thankful.

President Biden always talks about everyone paying their ""fair share"". How is it fair that I don't get relief but some student does? How is it fair that I helped keep the economy going and they didn't? How is it fair that my small business is seeing increased fees, taxes and regulatory hurdles while these people are griping about not being able to make ends meet in some of the most expensive cities in the world? Choices have consequences. These people chose to take out those loans as did I. I am paying mine back. Why can't they? And why is that my tax dollars are being used to shoulder these bailouts? That is what they are, bailouts. President Biden needs to stop with the pandering to the minority voting blocs and start listening to the working class American taxpayer. We are tired of our money becoming more useless by the day due to increased government spending and borrowing and relief programs like this. Enough with the election year lies.

Student debt interest should be waived permanently as a first measure. Any student debt that can be forgiven, should be forgiven. Any that cannot for whatever reason should be encouraged to be forgiven by the responsible entities through incentives and/or punishments in other forms.

If those who make money off the backs of innocents have a problem with it? Tax them further. After all, they've gotten enough breaks - just look at the PPP loans that were forgiven, for one example, and the entire history of tax cuts for the rich and corporations.

Remove all the interest, credit the loans for all the payments that have been made, and you will see that most people have paid back the original loan amounts. Most people have paid off the original loan amount and are just pay interest.

I am a contributing member of the workforce in a not-for-profit sector. I am a small business owner. I am a university graduate, with honors. I had to use federal loans to support my university career, despite my best efforts to reduce the cost. I was in the honors program, I received scholarships, I even went to a community college at first to reduce how long I would need to be at a 4-year institution. I even lived at home while attending! And yet, I still came out of it with over $20,000.00 in debt. But I planned to pay it all off, for sure. I had the greatest hopes of a well-paying job and a plan to get my debt paid off in only five years by paying double the minimum payment (if possible).

For two years I never missed a payment on my loans. It was the minimum payment, but I knew in just ten years I would be free of my student loan debt. Once the COVID-19 pandemic hit, however, the ability to pay on my loans swiftly declined. Not only was I getting paid less, and well-paying jobs were harder and harder to come by, the price to even live was getting higher than ever in my young life. I was side-swiped by the pandemic before I could even get my feet on the ground as a full member of society.

Everyday I question why I even bothered getting a bachelors degree if I was just going to end up the same as all my peers who didn't get a degree: poor and struggling. Where was my promised ""better life"" and ""prestigious dream job""? At least my peers didn't have an insurmountable debt hanging over them, like a sword dangling from a horsehair above my head.

With the SAVE Income-Driven Repayment Plan, I see a way for me to finally pay for my living expenses, repair my home, and, maybe, build up some savings, instead of living paycheck-to-paycheck. This program would greatly benefit myself and my husband. It would allow us to start a family, contribute more to society, and finally be able to have some financial peace.

Extraordinary circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, require extraordinary measures. Why should the poor and indebted be forced to suffer further, when relief is available? Every other loan available to US Citizens can be discharged through bankruptcy, except for student loans. Credit cards and personal (payday) loans that fund poor life choices and living beyond one's means can be discharged, but not student loans that were taken in an attempt to better oneself. If bankruptcy cannot discharge student loans, we deserve an alternate path to discharge them, without having to be permanently disabled.

Additionally, student loans are no longer optional for most students. College and university tuition costs have become unmanageably steep. Once more, despite living from home and attending the ""cheapest"" locally available university, I still had $20,000 worth of debt. Either prices must be wrangled or loans must have a better path to forgiveness/discharge. Preferably, prices will be better regulated for future students, and former students, like myself, will receive a break as compensation for being subject to an unfair and rigged system. A system that breaks down entirely from a single nationwide disaster must be fixed.

I write this all in hopes that whoever actually takes the time to read it will understand the position of the average student loan debtor and have some semblance of good-will to their constituents.

Thank you for your consideration.","Individual",,,,,,

I wanted to comment about the proposed legislation and how it does not include anyone who worked at a private for-profit organization that advocates for children with mental health issues and/or disabilities and utilizes Medicaid dollars to provide such services. I worked for an organization for over 6 years that, if it had been a non-profit, would have allowed me to have my loans forgiven already under the new PSLF rules and waiver. However, since it was considered to be a ""for-profit,"" I was unable to count those years towards my forgiveness. I have been paying off my loans steadily since then, only taking a short pause at the height of the pandemic when I had been laid off and loan payments took a pause. I can tell you that even though it was a for-profit company, we didn't get paid like it was. I don't think I was paid more than someone at a non-profit in a similar role and my healthcare benefits were arguably not as good.

It would be a real help if you could look at organizations, such as the one I worked for - MAS Community Health in Bangor, Maine, and determine that the work we did was the same or similar as those non-profits in the same area or other states that utilized government funding like Mainecare (Medicaid), and that we should have at least SOME of the payments we made while working there to count towards our overall Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

These individuals chose to attend college and take out loans to cover the cost of their education. This was a personal choice then, and remains a personal choice now. To alter the regulations so that individuals are not accountable for their choices is a blatant attempt to curry favor before the next election.

Because student loans are so easily given out, colleges have been incentivized to add more amenities to their campuses, allowing them to charge more and more for tuition. This is turn creates a 'keeping up with the Jones' attitude as colleges attempt create the illusion of value. 

The nation is in dire straits when it comes to the budget, and adding billions of dollars onto the federal debt is not going to solve anything. 

I started college in 2006, took a 2 year sabbatical, came back and finished in 2012. between that time my tuition doubled without any appreciable benefit to me, while the university doled out funding to upgrade items such as the gym, that added little value to the average student.

I was able to graduate without any debt because I worked my way through school, earning the funds necessary to live and attend. 

Perhaps the government should look at ways to adjust how loans are administered. Reduce the interest rates charged on loans so that people are not forced into paying ridiculous amounts. Require schools to justify the cost of tuition in order to be eligible for student loan payments. Create separate accounts for student loans, where we could focus on portions paid as tuition versus the amounts received by students in the form of change checks that then become their living expenses.

But forgiving loans is a slap in the face to the individuals who worked hard for their tuition, worked hard to qualify for scholarships and grants, and worked hard to qualify programs such as the GI bill.

I fear that by going down this road, the government will make schooling out of the reach for people like my 3 children.","Parent/Relative",,,,,,

I was a Pell Grant recipient for my undergrad education and had to take out student loans for my graduate education despite having a stipend due to the high cost of housing at my graduate program. While my balance is high, it is the equivalent of needing 758 a month for living expenses for 10 years. The median household income in my graduate school's county was nearly 4000 a month during my years I lived there and I was not paid in summers. My student loans paid my rent as my parents are blue-collar working adults who could not pay my way and while I worked as a teaching assistant during my time - I have constantly worked since I was 18 - the university did not provide affordable housing to its graduate students, forcing us to either take out loans or live in poor housing conditions if we didn't have rich parents.

I have paid my debt regularly and even as a high earner now, I have hesitated to sign for current IDR because it would be higher than the 890 a month I pay now, which would make it difficult for our household to pay our bills on time.

This student loan forgiveness is totally unfair to the citizens that worked and paid for their college education. Why should anyone even consider transferring their debt onto others, unless they stood to gain something by it. 

These students choose their school, their major and the amount of time they spent in school knowing full what they were getting into. There were other means available to get a degree, just not as prestigious as they wanted.  They knew what the job market was paying for their skill set - yet continued to run up tremendous bills that you are trying to pass onto others. 

What gives you the power to do this-the Supreme Court already told you differently. You are spending a ridiculous amount of time and money creating ways to circumvent the law of the land and force the rest of the country to pay for it.

To whom it may concern,

I am glad that these discussions are occurring.  I have a doctoral degree in psychology.  I owe $321,000 in student loans.  My balance has gone up over 70k in the past 10 years.  Unfortunately, I do not qualify to have the entirety of my interest forgiven because I make to much money as a single tax filer.  I implore you to take a blanket stance on interest forgiveness as opposed to making it about  tax filing status.  Just because I happen to be single does not mean that I have accrued less interest than a married counterpart and therefore should be subject to the same policy as married and head of house hold filers.

I also believe that the negotiated rule making has missed the mark on several areas of potential forgiveness. I have attached a letter that I submitted to studentaid.gov to implore them to consider my employer for PSLF.  We provide a public service - correctional healthcare - but since a private entity signs my check, I do not qualify for PSLF.  Expanding the definition of what public service is defined as was discussed in session two of the negotiated rule making sessions and I was hoping to see that included in these proposals.  Anyone working in healthcare is a public servant and should be afforded the same eligibility as all public service workers, regardless of who signs their paycheck.

Finally, another area of missed opportunity is setting a new interest rate for federal loans.  My loans have a 6.85% interest rate, which clearly states that it is set forth by the Department of Education.  Using a 1% or 2% interest rate would allow for me make progress paying down my principal instead of staying stagnant in my balance.

A college education is a luxury, not a necessity.  

There are far too many adults and children living in the streets that are food challenged, and/or shelter challenged which should be addressed. Also, there are too many children in public schools that are not reading at their grade level.  The future of our country cannot improve without these issues being addressed first. Our foundation needs to be fixed before addressing the needs of a few that made poor decisions. 

Many hard-working taxpayers have outstanding debts from Katrina, Covid and other natural disasters which they did not cause or create on their own nor stood to benefit from.  If any group should be assisted, it is suggested they should be helped first as they continue to work, pay their taxes and pay down their SBA loans (Katrina was almost 20 years ago).  

The working, tax-paying individuals are the ones keeping this country afloat and should be the first in line for any assistance or benefits from the taxes they have paid.

The programs are not funded by the government, they are funded by the tax paying individuals.  Everyone needs to be reminded of where the money comes from.

The ramifications are that no contracts need to be honored and that the supreme court can be ignored. ",,,,,,,

   A student loan is a loan of choice for a higher level of education, a student loan should not be a quality of living loan!
   A student should also qualify for these loans with adequate grades and attendance. This is not a free ride for the next four years of a party life.
   They sign on the agreement that they will pay back all the money they have borrowed with interest.
    Student loans should be reviewed when the student wants to finance a auto loan or purchase a home, or ""luxury' items. To make sure that the student can afford the payments and interest for a payoff in a timely manner.
    Your free education is K thru 12 at that time you should have an idea if college is a proper option for you. There is no point in 4 years of college and an advanced degree, to be a Walmart greeter!
    K thru 12 should help direct a high school graduate, to their future, to me you need a few items to enter the word and succeed.
   Attitude, Personality, Ability, Ambition, then Education or Training or Experience, most high schools have some form of an industrial arts program.
   Welders, mechanics, truck drivers, ditch diggers, etc. all make good money with very little monetary expense to get started in the industry.
   These students that borrow so much money need to take a financial education class explaining how interest accrues, how much interest you will pay on that loan in a given amount of time, a realistic time-line for loan repayment. We see the same problems that home buyers get caught up in, and auto purchase mistakes, and of course the EVIL world of Credit Cards.
   Price shopping for an education is a necessity don't go for the high dollar name when you can get a quality education affordably.
   I am certain that there is a lot of faults on the colleges for over charging students, and overpaying for various professors, and university presidents that make enormous wages, and football coaches that make wages to great excesses.
   This problem needs to be controlled.
   The banking and credit world should be controlled, it seems that the interest rates have gone out of control.
    It should be against the law to be granted a loan that does not have a fixed interest rate, variable rate loans are a banker's secret to making huge amounts of money, the loan that was affordable to you when taken out now has a much higher interest rate, thus the payments are higher, and the payoff amount is larger. They want you to make the low minimum monthly payment so that they can keep raking in all the interest money every month. Credit cards are the same too.
   In the long run student loans are a personal option, you sign for the loan guaranteeing that you will repay that amount plus interest, no forgiveness allowed.
    I pay my bills i paid for my education, i paid off my home i have paid off several cars and i pay off my credit cards, be responsible and pay back the money you borrowed with interest, after all nobody wants to see their financial investments fail.
    If you want to do something for the USA control the medical expenses that are destroying, peoples lives, medical crises are not avoidable, Health Insurances are horribly expensive we can't control when we get sick or how much it will cost us, myself i have had medical debt that i repaid that would have paid for a nice house.
    Absolutely no college debt forgiveness!!!!

Likewise, there are the parents of the students or another responsible party who absorbed the expenses while the student attended classes. Are they going to be reimbursed? The answer to that question is not likely! I paid for my son's college education while he attended classes and lived at home. Are you going to pay me some of that money back? Again, the answer is not likely! To wipe away debt for a student loan is thoughtless, intolerable and callous.

My thoughts are in relation to the RIDICULOUS proposed idea of debt relief for loans willfully obtained with the promise of repayment by individual(s).  The responsibility lies SOLELY with anyone who obtains loans from these departments and IS NOT the responsibility of the general public to become ultimately responsible to bear the burden of absorbing these loans through increased taxes.  If you take out a loan YOU agree to take the full responsibility for repayment of the loan(s).  Those of us who took responsibility for paying back loans that we incurred ARE NOT responsible for paying the loans of those who choose/refuse to pay back THEIR loans.  I worked several part-time jobs in addition to my full-time job to pay my own loans back because I CHOSE to take out the loans with repayment being my SOLE responsibility.  What is fair about shifting some of the burden(through increased taxes) for those who did not take out loans for higher education to pay-off the loans for those who chose to take out higher education loans?  REALLY, this whole proposed loan forgiveness program is simply a political ploy in an election year to ""BUY"" votes from those who stand to benefit from the loan forgiveness program.  ANY debt forgiven by some is ultimately ""PAID"" for by others as a shift in taxation.  PEOPLE WERE NOT forced to take out their higher education loans and should ""ONLY"" be the ones to pay back these funds without government assistance.  How about taking RESPONSIBILITY for one's own actions/decisions!     ","Other",,,,,,

The poorest communities get federal aid, as they should, but this aid does not extend to enough students. My parents have worked their entire lives to support my brother with the sole goal of being able to help my brother and I get an undergraduate education. Neither of them obtained a bachelors degree of their own. Even after all they saved for us, they couldn’t cover it all and I still had to take on student loans, for an in-state public university. I also worked part-time throughout most of my undergraduate education and full-time during summer breaks. Since graduation, outside of the COVID deferral period, I have been able to make regular payments towards my federal loans. I also have a private loan that I paid off this year. When I was still making payments on both, it was almost $500/month and that was only the minimum payments. In contrast, I had friends with the exact same degree, similar salary and career prospects, who have been able to save $500/mo more than me just because their parents were able to pay for their entire education. This is how inequality grows. Because of how much my parents paid to put my brother and I through school, they may never be able to retire. My friends who didn’t have to take on student loans are saving to start a family, and/or buy a house, and will never have to worry about taking care of their parents who gave them everything they had. This is how inequality grows. If the federal government is interested in continuing to exacerbate wealth inequality, it can continue to punish hard-working families under the current system, if the federal government instead would like to make progress toward equality, it should forgive federal student loans.",,,,,,,

Criminal justice majors, nurses, radiology technology, dental assistants, dental hygienists, teachers, plumbers, mechanics, HVAC, and welders (the list is not all-inclusive) are middle-class American careers that need help to relieve their loan debts. The interest is difficult to overcome. I have been enrolled in PSLF 13 yeas and when my loans were moved to MOHELA all the information was lost. I tried to have all my previous employers fill out the information again and resubmit, (I accomplished this over a few weeks) which was very time-consuming. It was all lost a 2nd time! MOHELA and The Department of Education mailed me a $15 check and said they were sorry they lost my information. This is not acceptable in any way shape or form! Also having to work for a non-profit limits jobs and provides bias as to what type of careers can apply, not all jobs are offered at non-profits. Nurses work hard everywhere they work as do other providers of healthcare and this one stipulation keeps MANY public servants from being able to qualify for this debt relief. The pay is the same at both entities for-profit and not-for-profit. If the loans are allowed to be relieved or the interest is allowed to be relieved, it would be a blessing to those of us who will be paying on these loans until we are 70 or 80 years old. It's not like a house where you build equity and can sell and knock off debt. Due to loan costs, I have not been able to save for retirement. At the end of the day, the cost of education is the real issue and where change has to occur. America needs to provide at least 1-2 years of college (associates or technical training) for free after High School. There are a few states that do offer this through lottery sales and bravo to them! This is needed! How can we offer this to all states, and it be federally funded? We waste plenty of tax dollars on irrelevant spending and we could be building a strong workforce. Education loans should always be LOW interest loans, not tied to regular interest rates. Student loans should also be allowed to go into bankruptcy. When people choose to bankrupt, they are at their last option financially. Families suffer when a loved one bankrupt due to health, cancer, etc and yet still have a student loan sitting there adding up interest. Shame on the Department of Education for allowing student loan debt to not be bankrupted by financially suffering Americans who pay the bills of America with their tax dollars and yet bail out airlines, restaurants, credit card companies, and retail stores or allow them to bankrupt on massive debt not even close to price tag on student loans of Americans. Real human people in middle-class America suffer from these outdated and ignorant rules and yet the rich get the handout! If someone is allowed to go bankrupt in a court of law due to a financial crisis and is found with the inability to make good on their debt, why would their student loan debt be any different? I am for relief of some student loans, but not for the rich or debt from IVY League schools. They needs to be exempt from this relief, as well as any degree that does not build the middle-class American workforce. We are the ones who pay the majority of the taxes and provide income for the government to pay its bills. We are also the ones who get the least in return for our tax dollars and suffer from a lack of actual representation by our elected officials. Congress is no longer listening to its constituents and is making a mockery of our great Country with their back and forth left and right bickering and personal agenda spending. Before the Federal Reserve was in place, the American people used to vote for what they wanted done with their tax dollars. We desperately need to go back to that, and abolish the Federal Reserve, STOP THE WASTE AND SPENDING, let Americans have an actual say once again how their tax dollars are spent. I would like to see relief for middle-class American's education debts. We have been paying for our loans for years with no reduction in totals. We also have been paying our taxes into the government coffers. It would be nice to get something back for my tax dollars for a change. I support this education debt relief help for select Americans. Yes, I know it is a hot-button topic and many paid their debts off already and it seems unfair. It is unfair. However, not all of us have been fortunate enough to do that, have suffered hardships, health issues, and loss, and could desperately use the help. We are those Americans who would give you the shirt off our back, and help you anytime you need it. We have been paying our student loan debt for years on end, doing our very best, yet are overwhelmed with the same debt we started with years ago, do not have retirement or savings, and could use help from our tax dollars.","Financial Aid Administrator",,,,,,

Firstly, the income basis allowed for loan forgiveness is set much too high, and clearly represents a transfer of funds from lower income tax payers to higher income people who have had the fortune of gaining education and knowledge.  It is unfortunate that some former students have not been able to repay the loans that they made assurances that they would have paid back. I fully accept that the failure to pay back loans has been due to circumstances beyond the control of the borrowers.  However, despite how innocent of malice these borrowers may be, their innocence is less than that of NON borrowers who took out no loans or who paid them back in full.  These non-borrowers should not be held accountable for the misfortunes of others and particularly not for the misfortunes of people who have, through their borrowing of student loans, been better able to gain knowledge and pursue dreams.

If the decision is made to go forward with this sort of loan forgiveness - which is a reduction in the amount due to the Treasury in future years and which shortfall will have to be made up somehow, and again, this should not, morally, be a burden carried by non-borrowers and non college attendees - then at a minimum, the income strata for permitting loan forgiveness should be far, far lower.  A more fair limit would be less than or equal to the median income of non-college attendees, averaged over the last five years.  Under no circumstances should this limit be greater than the national income average.  (As it currently stands, the loan forgiveness income levels are 1.8 to 2 times the average income.  This is a travesty, and whichever officials decided that this level was appropriate should be embarrassed by their lack of scope.)

Two additional notes: First - in order to prevent the appearance of allowing dishonest activity, the income rates for allowing loan forgiveness must be averaged over a period of time.  Ten years would be ideal, five years at a minimum.  While it is true that this puts a burden on the borrower being forgiven to collect this paperwork, the return is a sizable amount of money.

Second - the elevated income allowed for surviving spouses is inappropriate.  As student loans (unlike most debts) are owed by the living person and not the estate, there is no cause for allowing additional income for a surviving spouse, as they do not have an elevated debt burden.

I say all of the above as a college graduate who funded their education partly through self-funding and partly through loan assistance due to military service.  I recognize the great degree to which I have been blessed, and my negative stance on most loan forgiveness comes from a recognition that many borrowers struggling under large loans are in that situation due to their own actions as self-directed, voting age adults.  Citizenship comes with responsibility.

Finally, and most importantly - the blatant self-serving political bribery that this particular loan forgiveness program represents is abhorrent.  That this administration is preying on first, the stress and fears of debt burdened borrowers and second, the giving nature and good intentions of those of us who are not in that situation is despicable. You are not good stewards of the public purse and you should be ashamed of your selves. That this proposal comes shorn of any semblance of real reform, so that we *stop*, NOW, the continued distribution of these loans and decide to not further saddle more citizens with this debt is the best proof of the bad intent and poor judgement of those behind this proposal. This is a bad idea, and you should feel bad.","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,

I believe that I and other taxpayers should not have to pay for the decision to take student loans.  It is a debt that the loaner is responsible to pay. 
It aggrieves me that I paid for my post secondary education by choosing to attend affordable state universities and working my way through  undergraduate and graduate education. I also, paid for my child’s post secondary education. At great sacrifice.

I appreciate the ideas proposed but find them far too limiting and lacking understanding of the big picture. We are talking about people who for years struggled with a burdensome decision they made at age 17. For example, when I was going to college, I applied to state schools and got rejected, the only school I could get into was a private school which costs much more money. It was also 2008 when the financial system crashed and the job market was not favorable to college students at the time. Graduate school is the only option for my career path which added further student loan debts to my name. It's been well over a decade and my loans have only grown (over $110,000 now). The economy has not improved the situation either. I got married and our financially burden of student loans doubled because, again, my husband's career required a degree (add his $60,000). 
Here is the main issue I have with these ideas, it is missing the fact that for years, those struggling have utilized (and were encouraged to do so) deferments and forbearances just to survive. I purpose that regardless of payments made, that after 20 years of the debt burden and attempting our best to pay what we can, that the full balance be dismissed. The older we get, the more financial responsibilities we have and the student loans become impossible. For example, we live in Hawaii so my husband can work his government job (worked 15 years for the government and still can't get an update on when his loan is dismissed), we can barely afford 1 old car, 50% of our income goes to housing, and we have two widowed Mother's financially depending on us for their elderly care (because we come from low income families, hence the need for student loans in the first place). We are unable to afford to have children (childcare alone is pricey and so is fertility treatments to get a family started).
My suggestion: A) The full amount by which the current outstanding balance on a loan exceeds the amount owed when the loan entered repayment for loans being repaid regardless of the loan program or CURRENT income- because my husband has been trying to get on PSLF and it's a poorly structured and failing program as well as current income means nothing when you compare states/cost of living
Also, edit PSLF, I've heard about several teachers who've been laid off a few months/years short of the full 10 years and no longer eligible. Make it year by year.
B) Dismiss all of the current outstanding balance on a borrower's loan that exceeds the balance owed upon entering repayment- there shouldn't be interest on these loans anyways, government is already profiting from these loans by people getting education and boosting the economy.
C) There needs to b some kind of boarder dismissal of loans for people who actually utilized their education, pursued graduate school or a career in the field they got their degree for. Again, the government profits from people pursuing education for their careers, the economy is dependent on advanced educations to compete in the world, why are we financially strapping down the people who are our future?

I resent now seeing taxpayer's money and/or borrowed money used to pay doctors, lawyers, teachers and other professionals.

I feel like there is no hope for me to get my loans forgiven. I had to quit school before I could even finish my degree because my father had a heart attack and so my family's finances were stretched thin and they couldn't co-sign on another term for me to finish my degree.

The money needed for such massive loan forgiveness would be saddled onto we the taxpayers, who did not sign up for this.  Having said that, my own daughter has app 150k in student loans but she is now graduated, is working, and has a solid plan to pay it off and is doing so.  That's called being responsible.  What is being proposed here is irresponsible. And let's face it; the federal government is no poster child for fiscal responsibility, as we as a country are so much in debt now that the interest on that debt has reached 1 trillion dollars (that's a thousand billion dollars).  How about working on reducing THAT debt?

Why just address student loans when millions of Americans are saddled with other debts e.g. credit cards, mortgages, car loans etc.  Are you going to forgive those loans too?  
 
I think this is nothing more than a ploy from the current administration to win votes from young voters in the upcoming presidential election.  

Cancelling student load debt to those who can lease afford it, while ignoring those people who have paid their loans or are paying their loans, is rewarding people for bad behavior.  And that, in my opinion, is a recipe for fiscal disaster.","Individual",,,,,,

I am a medical student that will graduate in June 2024 and work as a primary care doctor in family medicine and I have already amassed about $300,000 in student loans. Due to the massive loan amount, it has been accruing interest very rapidly even though the loans are still in in school-deferment/ nonpayment. This is because they are graduate school loans, or direct unsubsizided loans and graduate plus loans that accrue interest since the disbursement date. 

While my loans were in deferment/ non-payment during the time I was still completing my degree in school, I have accrued close to $11,000 in interest since just October 2023. I humbly request you to consider forgiving at least the interest charged to student loans while they were in in-school deferment/ nonpayment status while we were full-time students not earning any income. 

I would also encourage you to consider other partial loan forgiveness options for medical student loans in general. Many of us go into lower paying specialties such as primary care where our income to debt ratio is not reasonable. As someone that is coming from a lower-middle class background, I do not have family financial support to fall back on. I received the pell grant in college and my family qualified for food stamps, free lunch, and medicaid growing up. It will be very challenging to pay off my student loans with the steep 8% interest rate while also trying to start a family/ support my household. Residency salary is just ~$60,000 a year for several years. I would appreciate any kind of loan forgiveness that you could offer medical students with $300,000+ in debt and humble financial backgrounds going into primary care specialties.

On the positive side, targeted debt relief measures could significantly reduce the financial burden on borrowers facing specific circumstances. By addressing issues such as excessive loan growth or attendance at institutions subject to secretarial actions, these regulations aim to alleviate financial strain, potentially freeing up disposable income for borrowers to spend on other goods and services. This could stimulate economic activity and contribute to overall economic growth. Additionally, reduced loan obligations may lead to increased consumer spending, benefiting sectors such as retail, hospitality, and entertainment. Moreover, lower levels of student loan debt could enhance economic mobility for borrowers, enabling them to pursue homeownership, invest in higher education for their children, or start businesses, thereby contributing to long-term economic prosperity and reducing income inequality.

However, there are also potential negative impacts to consider. The provision of debt relief through the waiver of Federal student loan debt could have budgetary implications, impacting government spending and fiscal policy. Additionally, while targeted debt relief may benefit certain borrowers, there is a concern about moral hazard and the potential for borrowers to take on excessive debt with the expectation of future forgiveness. Moreover, there may be unintended consequences, such as changes in borrower behavior or institutional practices, in response to the availability of debt relief. Finally, there is a risk of increased reliance on government intervention in the student loan market, which could have broader implications for the functioning of the financial system. Overall, while the proposed regulations offer potential benefits in terms of alleviating student loan debt burdens, careful consideration of the potential drawbacks and unintended consequences is essential in assessing their overall economic impact.","Academic/Think Tank",,,,,,

President Biden who I voted for, should cancel all student loans; mine especially, because I cannot afford to buy a home due to my current student loans with interest gaining daily. I started school in my early 40s and tuition and books were ridiculously expensive and the books we had to purchase some had to be bought when the older editions could not be used but had the same materials.

I am currently supporting my 3 grandchildren, and I cannot afford to pay these loans and raise 3 children under 14.

Higher education should be a blessing to be able to earn a degree and be able to earn a decent annual salary and live comfortably because we as students want to better our lives for our families and ourselves.

I got all the way through PhD school and took out 50k in student loans. I have been paying on time for 10 years and currently owe $72k+. I am a first-generation college student. I remember filing for FAFSA when I was 17 and NOTHING made sense to me and my mom. This was confusing not just because I was the first to attend college in my entire family, but I was required to use my mom's income even though I was living on my own, renting my own apartment, and completely independent from my mom. When Obama first launched the ability to pay our loans back on an income-driven repayment, I felt so blessed. Part of that reason is because although I had gone all the way to PhD school, on a Thurgood Marshall Fellowship to Western Michigan University, and a full scholarship to my doctorate, I couldn't afford to live while going to school. Further, when I graduated, I was only paid $29,000 per year by the community college I was teaching at with no benefits offered. I had to teach at three colleges and bartend at night and on the weekends just to afford a one-bedroom apartment. As a person that grew up low-income, I felt stuck. Not only was I told by teachers, community leaders, and politicians that college was important, I was told that I would find a job in the field I graduated that would pay me enough to become a participating and engaged member of society. Instead, I struggled. I am telling you this story because I am not the only one that shares this experience. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for considering forgiving the interest that has made paying my student loans back so difficult. I am a hard-working productive member of society, a homeowner, and a mother. Please don't give up this fight. We need help. ",,,,,,,

I have taken on debt for cars, houses, student loans etc. most of my adult life.   But I was required to pay back the money and the interest on that money.   It took years to pay off those loans.   Paying off the loans was certainly not easy with one income (partbof the time) and a family to feed, clothe and educate.  But we managed, sometimes great sacrifices were made in order to not fall behind and wreck our credit.  

The students who have unpaid loans agreed to pay back the student loans when they took the money.  And thats what needs to happen here.  When you commit to borrowing money you need to be responsible and pay it back. 

1) If the student loans are forgiven the borrowers don’t learn about being responsible for their debts. 
2) It is unfair to the rest of the taxpayers to be responsible for these students debt.   Like me for example who paid off my student loans.   And I have a mastera degree. 
3) The government debt is already out of hand and this is just foolish to favor one segment of the population over the others. 
4) Every federal government agency needs to be thinking smart about their budgets and the debt they are causing other citizens . And every government employee must be focused on controlling spending, not increasing our national debt to levels way beyond reason.   The debt levels are not sustainable, and could bring down this great nation.  We need to act now!  And quit being stupid with our spending.

When I was able to start paying the loan it had increased so much due to interest and I struggled to meet the minimum amount due. To this date 2024, I owe over 16K. Somewhere along the line my servicer put part of loans in a repayment plan while leaving some in forbearance. The interest rates are killing me and I will never get this loan paid off. 

We need some type of relieve from at least the interest rates racking up while we struggle to pay. 

Some people get offered high paying jobs after graduating. I struggled because I went to a community college and only pursued an associate's degree because I was afraid of borrowing more money from the government not knowing if I would be able to pay it back. 

I thought that I was going to be able to get my loan paid down quickly but that failed when I could only get a job making $10 per hour.

I am all for some type of relief. I believe not accruing any interest if you are unable to pay. Or maybe a lower interest rate.

I understand many people feel like those who took out student loans should have to pay the full amount back and should of known this going into it. I don't necessarily disagree with the those claims, however the student loan process is built for people to stay in debt. If I could feasibly pay off my student loans in the way I do my car or credit cards etc, I would happily do so. My generation was told if you didn't go to college you would amount to nothing and make little money. There was no education on choices for trade schools or alternative options and you were made to feel ""less than"" if you didn't go to college. Unfortunately, my parents couldn't afford to save for college, but their income was ""too much"" for me to receive any grants. I was also a first generation college student, so there wasn't much education around what college was going to look like. When signing up to get financial aid I was always told to get the maximum I could rather than just for what would cover tuition, because ""it will get forgiven anyways"". The job I wanted to go into, which is in the area of psychology/mental health field, requires a Master's degree and again there are little options for scholarships at the graduate level. Much like undergrad I worked multiple jobs to pay my rent and other expenses outside of tuition to get through school. NOTHING was handed to me. When I completed my graduate program, I got a job working as an acute mental health therapist, which doesn't pay much because it's in the public service sector and did my best to pay my student loans. Unfortunately, with approximately $50,000 in loans, the required income based repayment was roughly $800. Again, I was working in a career position that is much needed and underfunded, so I could not make those payments and was forced into a forbearance. My student loans continued to accrue interest during that time, on top of the capitalized interest that was added to my balance after graduating from undergraduate and graduate programs. The interest was more than what I was accruing on my car and mortgage (3%-6%$), with the continued fear that if I messed up on any paperwork or deadline I would default and that would be on my credit report forever. No agency or department should be making money off of student loan borrowers, so I never understood why there was such high interest rates on a loans you can't file bankruptcy on or is not based on any credit or income requirement. The whole system is rigged to fail. The student loan services have continued to fail borrowers by providing shady advice and purposevely rejecting or ""losing"" paperwork. I thankfully belong to a PSLF facebook group who has done a better job at education borrowers on different programs and options than Mohela or MyFedLoan ever did, and they don't get paid to do so. Again, I do think this has improved since COVID-19, however Mohela just messed up many accounts from Sept 2023 to Present and have yet to fix them. The majority of student loan borrowers are not people who took out loans just because, but rather to make their lives better and more meaningful. For example, all mental health therapist have to have a Master's to practice and not many can afford college outright. Do we really want to live in a world where there is no mental health supports, because colleges and student loan providers are wanting them to suffer their whole life with debt? This doesn't help our economy or culture. Same goes for teachers, most have Masters and do not get paid what they are worth. We will lose people in these positions if we continue to have the same student loan system. I also appreciate there are avenues for veterans to receive forgiveness dependent on their disability percentage. I think it would beneficial to look at if spouses of those who have 100% disability have some sort of forgiveness related to this. This is because they are also providing support to their spouse that could be causing financial hardship. Thank you for your time and consideration in reviewing public comments on these issues.

I am writing to advocate for the forgiveness of student loan payments by the federal government. Here are several compelling reasons why this policy change would benefit individuals, the economy, and society as a whole:

Economic Relief: Student loan debt has become a significant burden for millions of Americans. By forgiving these loans, we can provide immediate financial relief to borrowers, allowing them to allocate their resources toward other essential needs such as housing, healthcare, and saving for the future.

Boosting Consumer Spending: When borrowers are freed from student loan payments, they have more disposable income. This increased spending power can stimulate economic growth by supporting local businesses, creating jobs, and driving demand for goods and services.

Addressing Racial and Socioeconomic Inequality: Student loan debt disproportionately affects marginalized communities. Forgiveness would help bridge the wealth gap and promote equity, allowing individuals from all backgrounds to pursue higher education without the fear of lifelong debt.

Encouraging Entrepreneurship and Innovation: Many aspiring entrepreneurs delay starting their own businesses due to student loan obligations. By forgiving these debts, we empower individuals to take risks, innovate, and contribute to economic development.

Removing Barriers to Homeownership: High student loan balances often prevent young adults from qualifying for mortgages. Forgiveness would enable more people to achieve homeownership, strengthening the housing market and stabilizing communities.

Investing in Education and Lifelong Learning: Forgiving student loans sends a powerful message about the value of education. It encourages lifelong learning and motivates individuals to pursue advanced degrees or vocational training without fear of insurmountable debt.

In conclusion, student loan forgiveness is not only a compassionate policy but also a strategic investment in our collective future. By alleviating the burden of student debt, we can create a more equitable society, foster economic growth, and empower the next generation of leaders.

Thank you for considering this crucial issue.

As outlined, this program will:
1.  Teach the wrong lesson.  Those who have willfully taken out student loans need to realize that the debt that they assumed MUST be repaid in full, with interest accrued during the term of repayment.  --- By ""forgiving"" or ""cancelling"" any or all such debt teaches the wrong lesson because it teaches the person taking on such debt that they need not be responsible for their actions.

This burden on the American taxpayer comes at a time when taxpayers are already burdened by the current high cost of living and inflation.

You need to do some serious research into the Parent Plus loan debtors instead of pretending they're not struggling! If the students are struggling to repay their student loans, who do you think is financially supporting them during this struggle??! The ultimate backlash is going to be students fearing student loan debt and just opting out of going to college. Its no longer a guarantee of a good job, the means to buy a house, or supporting a family.  You need to think of the long term repercussions of ALL OF IT, as it will be far reaching.

People who assumed debt for tuition signed up for their debt, and the general public did not.  Many people did not go to school, went to work, or went to trade schools because it was what was right for them.

It is a miscarriage of justice to ask people who did not agree to incur others debt, to now carry it.  

It is shameful to ask people who are working overtime shifts, days off, and doing without things, to pay for what other people decided they wanted to pay for.  

There is no way that taxpayers should be saddled with tuition loan forgiveness.

If a student regards his/her degree and costs of the degree are not worth repaying the loans, then the degree and the costs of the degree are not worth my repaying the loan. 

My wife and I taught for more than 20 years with Window Rock Schools on the isolated Navajo Reservation in northeast Arizona where salaries remain lower than non-reservation districts in the states comprising the 4 Corners area. Our two children graduated from college (one with a graduate degree) and had no student debt. Both chose effective degree program that continue to be in demand. 4 grandchildren have graduated from college, and all chose effective degree programs that continue to be in great demand, and none had student debt. All worked during summers as well as winter and spring breaks instead of heading off to the beaches. They chose wisely. 

I have a total of 6 degrees and never carried debt. I chose wisely.

I completed my Associates Degree through Empire State College to become a Social Worker with survivors of domestic violence. I completed that degree and while in the middle of earning my Bachelors through Empire State, my husband was diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer Stage 3. I took a leave from school to care for him.

Upon his death, I asked for a extension to return to school so I could grieve while settling his estate and when settling his estate took longer than expected, I contacted Empire State and was told there would be no problems. Before my return date, I was notified that I had ""withdrawn from school"" and I would not be receiving any credits for the courses I completed from the Bachelors Degree prior to my husband's illness. 

I immediately consolidated my two loans, one I know is less than $12,000 through the Federal Direct programs and for the past 10 years have been on an income driven program NEVER missing a payment. My consolidated $60,000 in loans now has a balance of $69,309.00. I am a full time Nanny with one family for the past 14 years making $19.00 and unable to work any overtime or take on a second job for even with that extra amount, I am taking all of that money plus money from my check to make sure I qualified for affordable loan payments just so I don't default on my student loans.

I am now 58 years old and making minimum payments which will never be enough to make a dent in reducing my student loan debt. I will die with this debt and any relief that may come my way would be appreciated so I could save more for retirement.

I would like to support this proposal, I have another 10 years to make the 20 years at  age 69, to possibly qualify for student loan discharge. I have never defaulted on my student loans and have never been late or missed a payment. Just would like a little relief of what feels as heavy of a burden with as the loss of my husband would be appreciated. 
  
Thank you for your time to read my story.

So if you take a loan to fund your education, you are responsible for paying back the loan.

This message is in relation to the 30 day comment period for the President's student loan relief program. 

I truly appreciate that the President seems to be making every effort to keep his campaign promises. The world would be a better place if many others in politics did the same. 

Even if I did not have a large student loan (which I do) I would support this relief. At some point, colleges became purely business oriented, money-making enterprises rather than focusing on educating and preparing the students for real careers. Money was given out like candy as a matter of course in the form of loans without meaningful education on the implications and/or without school counseling to truly support and disclose other ways to pay for school such as work-study, scholarships, etc. My counselors failed to let me know that, with a 4.0+, I was eligible for scholarships. Their attention was too focused on the affluent/wealthy legacy students. I was just a brown girl with a single mom and two siblings trying to work hard and make good grades.

I hope that this measure passes and that people get the help that they need. The world could use more kindness and less people trying to hold other back.

Therefore, I am living paycheck to paycheck. I have not applied for state disability because I want to continue to work for as long as possible.  I take medication that costs over $30,000 a month and if it weren't for the medical insurance coverage and the pharmaceutical company, I would not be able to afford the medicine.  If I were on disability, it would be a burden to the government financially with treatment and medications.  I am currently in the SAVE program and fortunately I qualified for my payments to be postponed until early 2025.  I have no means of paying back the student loans nor do I see any means becoming available in 2025 so I will likely be forced to default or file bankruptcy if I am not granted some kind of forgiveness.  It pains me to read about those who have received forgiveness and refunds that were not based on current means but some other program.  While that is great for them, I am trying to ""rob Peter to pay Paul"" and keep my head just above water, I desperately hope I don't have to take such drastic measures as default or bankruptcy but I certainly have to prioritize where the money goes each month and my basic needs must be chosen first (housing, food, medication) and there is simple no money left over.  Sometimes we have to accept the cards we are dealt and my goals of achieving a master's degree had to cease when I became sick.  Otherwise, I planned on achieving my Ph.D. which one of my professors offered to assist me with once I completed the MBA program.  Well, unfortunately that did not happen and now I'm stuck working a job that pays minimally but it allows me to be self sufficient with no government assistance (up to now).  And, fortunately I don't hate my job which has also contributed to why I haven't applied for disability as some family and friends have suggested I do.  I feel like working as long as I can helps me mentally and this job fortunately allows me to work around my sometimes debilitating symptoms.  I hear people complain about ""it's not fair because others have already paid back their loans"" and make other complaints, but that is so utterly ridiculous and down right childish in my opinion because laws are made or changed all of the time and it's just the luck of the draw or ""it is what it is"" whether the new or amended laws benefit or don't benefit those affected.  Why shouldn't student loans be treated the same.  I don't hear many people complaining the country shouldn't lighten up on Marijuana laws because previously they were sentenced and served time in jail.  I could go on and on in support of student loan forgiveness but I won't.  I will add that if we can help non-American citizens in or outside of the U. S. or help other countries, why in the world would we not help our own too.  What goes around always comes around.  For those it helps, it may help keep them off of government assistance, it may even allow some to buy a home or a car to work, or put money back into the economy somewhere.  PLEASE OFFER FORGIVENESS FOR THOSE IN NEED AND WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HARDSHIPS.  I never intended not to pay the loans back, but life happens.  Had I been able to complete my goals and live my dream, I would need this relief.  But, unfortunately I do and I'm praying that my day will come (before my postponed payments resume).  ",,,,,,,

As a parent, I paid for my children to go to college. My son took out a student loan for the last year and he has been faithfully making payments. My children also had jobs while at college to pay for other items needed for college life.

My parents, a teacher and a mechanic, paid for my college education and I also had an on-campus job to pay for other items needed for college life.

As a taxpayer, I SHOULD NOT have to pay the costs for other people's children to attend college. These students need to make sacrifices to pay for college. If it is ""given"" to them, they will not appreciate it. Also, students should go to colleges they can afford. They don't have to go to Harvard or Vanderbilt. And, they should understand what awaits them when they graduate in the way of financial compensation. Someone doesn't need a $400,000 degree to be a schoolteacher that earns $50.000/year.

If there is going to be ""forgiveness"" of a loan, then the student should have to justify why they can't pay back the loan. Are they still buying $6 Starbuck coffee on a daily basis, eating out all the time, partying, going on vacations, buying things they don't need? Just a sweep across the board is NOT fair to those of us who are working hard to pay our own bills. 

You are also setting a bad example. Banks are not going to ""forgive"" a mortgage or car loan. A default by a borrower will result in foreclosure of the property or repossession of a car. Can I send you my mortgage? I would like to receive any amount of money to apply to my mortgage. 

Finally, I am disappointed you think you don't have to follow the ruling from the Supreme Court. Why are you exempt from that especially when you criticize your political opponents for doing the same thing. Such hypocrisy.

Bottom line, this is NOT your money. It's mine and every other taxpayer in the USA.

I am extremely disappointed in the Biden administration from top to bottom. You are doing NOTHING for the hard-working people. You continue to make the individual taxpayer financially responsible for situations where we have not been involved or approved of the transactions and are not associated with our family. 

I know I am not the only person that feels this way. I just hope other people take the time to notify you of what a very bad decision this is for the American taxpayer.

There has already been abuse of educational funding ie; spanish speaking student claiming they did not know spanish simply to receive funding and housing along with medical, dental, etc... while taking intro to spanish, cultures, foods, history, geography, etc. 

Some student debt is accumulated by professional students simply enjoying college life for as long as possible without pursuing a career, working well outside of their education.  

Bad precedent to set, where will it move next, medical, dental, home, car, life insurance... 

The worst optic is that the administration is buying votes by relieving debt which is the same as giving people money to vote for them, especially in an election year.  ","Federal Agency",,,,,,

These students took out a loan to further their education at taxpayer's expense.  This will undoubtedly give them a better opportunity for higher paying positions in their careers, and likely edging out those without a college education, although as qualified.  Not all college graduates are the most qualified candidates!!!!    

Now, they want the higher paying jobs, better opportunity and forgiveness of their loans!  What about the students that worked through college and paid their own way?  What do they get?  What about people that lose a job to college graduates?  

It is not the taxpayers' responsibility to put kids through college.  Also, this loan and repayment terms were agreed to by the students and their families.  Why would anyone even think about cancelling their debt?????  Well, I guess Biden and his inept administration would.  

Doesn't one think that this money should be used for the betterment of society as a whole; i.e., helping the homeless, truly disabled, research for diseases that don't have adequate funding, etc. 

If there are extentuating circumstances for a few students, those should be addressed individually.  But NOT forgiving all the loans....

As a taxpaying citizen and one who has paid debts that I have agreed to, I am offended and very angry that this administration would even consider such a ridiculous program.

You are teaching kids to further their sense of entitlement and encouraging irresponsibility towards debt.

The whole premise of student loans was that anyone could afford to go to college, but since student loan interest rates are so high, this is not true. Work on this problem and stop trying to coerce people to vote for you by paying for their loans.

The plan was to create a better lifestyle for me and my future family. After an unsuccessful marriage, I refuse to give up and on my future plans but as a single mother I struggled tremendously despite having a college degree. Therefore, I decided to obtain a bachelor degree in Social Work. Unfortunately, that didn’t enhance our lives much either. I suddenly found myself over $40,000 in student loan debt. However, my salary was barely $32,000. My income put me at the threshold of not qualifying for SNAP benefits or housing assistance. I spent over a decade struggling to stay current on paying my accrued debt while also working diligently to simply maintain a roof over my son’s head, food to eat, and clothing. From 1999 to present, I’m still in debt although I’ve been paying as much as I could afford. I quit a MSW program once I realized my desire to own a home would never come to fruition if I continued to get deeper in debt. Plus it’s difficult to complete field placement hours and maintain a full time job although a part time job won’t cover living expenses. 
It’s a sad reality to know that trying to create a better future for yourself or loved ones comes at a cost that surpasses what your potential salary would be worth. 
While employed at MDCPS, I applied for PSLF and was denied. Once I received the denial letter I decided to leave the state as an employee because I felt the program was a scam. If, I would have been approved I’m sure I would have continued to be of service to the countless families in need of an advocate. I’ve worked in the public service sector twice since leaving MDCPS and I continued to make payments during the COVID deferment period. Yet, I still feel trapped in the endless and unfair cycle of educational debt. 
Thanks to my husband, I am now able to pursue my MSW degree again but based on our income I’m afraid I will never have my debt forgiven although I’ve paid my dues for 20 years. With high interest rates, low income, and even lower salaries I must say that the system is not designed to help a college graduate live comfortably after graduation. Hopefully this administration will provide support and relief to many people that are unfortunately in similar, or worse, situations than myself. ","Individual",,,,,,

My oldest daughter continued on for her Master's degree. My wife worked part time while raising our daughters and I worked many, many overtime shifts to save. In addition many thousands of dollars in loans were assumed towards the effort. Our family paid off each and every loan in their entirety over a period of years.

Now comes President Biden and our illustrious senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren who feel the urgent need to wipe out the student debt for thousands of debtors. It is apparent that both Biden and Warren have no concern for those of us that did the right thing. What about those who for the lack of money and / or family support were unable to attend college?
 
It has become painfully obvious to all that the desperation to garnish votes outweighs what is truly the right thing to do. By the way these billions of dollars of taxpayer money can be better utilized to assist the elderly and the veterans who have served our country. Biden and Warren pretend they are reaching into their pockets to foot the bill and come off as heroes. I'm sure the next thing on the agenda will include paying off the credit card debt that many over spenders have to deal with.

I have never voted on party lines, but rest assured if this is some sort of outreach to determine how the public will be voting, please know ahead of time that I will be voting for my neighbor who sells furniture before I vote for either of those two nitwits.

Despite this appreciation, your recent proposal to provide relief to ONLY those who fall under specific income limits is disheartening and quite frankly leaves out a large group of people who also could and should benefit from relief. 
MOST graduate school graduates and especially professional program degrees (MD, PA-C, engineering, JD, MBA, etc.) have incredibly large loan balances. Despite earning higher salaries, these graduates also have need for relief/assistance.  Of note, these salaries are more than appropriate for those with advanced degrees who spent years studying to obtain the credentials.  Individuals should not be penalized for earning more than $120K per year by instantly being excluded from relief.   Loan relief should NOT be based on income requirements, especially when interest rates are so high. 
Additionally, in your proposal there is no consideration or exceptions given to income limits for those who live in expensive cities and, as such, have salaries that are inherently higher. 
As a PA who has 175K in student loans at  a 7% interest rate, lives in a very expensive city and makes a respectable salary, my need is no different than someone making less than 120K. I would argue my need is greater. PSLF is not a realistic option in my case. 

The solution is not setting income limits, but rather fixing the interest rates for student loans. 
I would suggest reducing interest rates to a very low percentage (ie.1%) for everyone. The government will still make money, payments will be realistic, and most likely borrowers' balances won't balloon. 
Relief/forgiveness should be a flat % for anyone with federal loans regardless of income. Providing forgiveness/relief yearly at a flat percentage of total loan (example: 0.25%, 0.5%,1%, 2%) for all borrowers is realistic and fair. This type of help provides the same relief for all borrowers and more importantly does not exclude anyone with salaries >120 K. Those who paid back loans over the last 5-10 years should be granted a similar % tax break.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.

I began my undergraduate education in 2007 and required loans to supplement my scholarships. To pursue licensure as a psychotherapist, I was required to complete a masters degree. The total of my loans when they entered repayment was $97,522. I have been paying continuously since gaining employment in 2014, and even made payment during the suspension of required payments in 2020. The current balance of my loans is now $116,614. In 10 years of continuous repayment, my loans have grown by almost $20,000. 

My monthly payments do less than nothing to discharge my debt, but do take away from my ability to provide for myself and my family. At no time have I earned anything close to $120,000 a year. Meanwhile, costs of living, particularly housing, continue to rise. I know I am not alone.

As someone who had over 60k in student loans I did not want a handout from the government to wipe away my loans that I took on. I wasn’t hoodwinked into borrowing money to further my education. It was my choice. I went into postgraduate school knowing I would have to repay what I borrowed. I didn’t like having money taken out monthly, paying ahead, etc… but I knew I had to at the time I signed the dotted line. Paying them off 19 years early was fantastic. I am self-employed and lived within my means so that I could wipe the slate clean of these loans. 
Everyone knows what they are getting into when they borrow this money. Why should they expect yet another free handout when they knew what they were getting into?
Here’s an idea: instead of forgiving these loans for people, why not make the interest rate 0%? 
My interest rate was 6.25%, which accumulates shockingly fast if you don’t pay ahead. Maybe this is too simple of a solution. 
Bottom line is:
A. don’t take out a loan that is going to financially cripple you for decades

I served in the National Guard to help pay for college, but all expenses were my own to take care of. I had to pay tuition, books, and living expenses with only what I could do for myself. In my case, this meant loans, work study programs, GI Bill, and pell grants. It was difficult, but it has led to me being able to make it as a child of factory workers displaced from the labor market as jobs went overseas in the 90s.

I finally got a master's degree in social work in 2011, after years of attending school, at times part-time while I saved money, and at other times full-time when I was able. I often worked low paying jobs that allowed my schedule to be flexible enough to attend classes and work part-time, as well as working at least part-time in unpaid, required internships.

I got a job as a social worker in a grant-funded position, working toward PLSF. After nearly 5 years in that position, the grant ended, and I had to look for a different job, which is no longer eligible for PLSF.

After being various periods of being placed in deferments or forebearances by my servicer, MOHELA, I now owe approximately $40,000 more than my balance after graduating. I am in my mid-40s, and am worried about getting stuck with a massive tax bill if my balance is waived. I essentially expect to be stuck with this debt for most of my adult productive years. I have a child in college now, and still owe far more than I borrowed in the first place. 

My generation, especially those of us who came from poor factory families and blue collar workers were told to go to college, no matter what. We were told that college was our way out, our path to the American Dream. It has become an American Nightmare as we try to navigate Byzantine repayment programs, waiting on hold for hours to try and get a person on the phone at our servicer, and do everything in our power to help our children avoid student debt, no matter the cost.

Finally, part of my circumstances is exacerbated by the transition of public sector jobs to private contractors. The company I currently work for performs a role within my state that would typically be a state government function. However, many, if not most, traditional state government functions that would have been eligible for PLSF when the program went into effect are now sourced to private contractors. This has shrunk the potential employment pool for qualifying PLSF employers. This undermines the PLSF program, and leads to more people like myself, trapped in debt for decades with no relief in sight.

Student loan debt accounts for a huge chunk of my family of 4's total debt load. We have a mortgage, a car note, and student loans. We do not have credit card debt.

These proposed rule changes will be a huge relief to our family, and the sooner the better. Congress has allowed a waiver of the tax burden on forgiven loans through 2025 under COVID relief. If debt relief comes years down the road, myself others like me will end up with potentially 10s of thousands of dollars worth of unexpected tax liability to the IRS. In many cases, this would leave borrowers worse off as the IRS repayment would be more onerous than their IDR plan.

Congressional and executive inaction to manage the rate of rising tuition, the lack of investment in community colleges prior to 2010, or sufficient efforts to address students who graduated with unsustainable debt burdens and decades of repayment without making any progress on remaining balances.","Individual",,,,,,

President Obama and Vice President Biden sold the idea to Congress with the promise to use the interest made from those loans the help subsidize the Affordable Care Act.  President Biden is now plotting to cancel the interest on student loans which is the sole reason Congress authorized the Department of Education to make those loans.  Instead of just one program paying subsidies, now taxpayers are paying to subsidize two programs: the Affordable Care Act and federal student loans.
What I find bothersome about most of what I have read is that the government provided little to no oversight on what institutions were eligible for students to use federal loans for or what degrees students had to be working toward to make these loans and while I read there were limits on these loans, I have read time and again people saying they own hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loan debt.  If this program were to go on, there needs to be strict government oversight on what institutions students can attend to eligible to receive these loans and what degrees they must pursue to be eligible for them too.  People used this money for things other than their education, went to their dream college or university with excessive tuition costs, majored in degrees that are saturated or unnecessary in the competitive job market.  This equates to waste, fraud, and abuse to me.  How can the government offer student loan defense to people who took out loans if it did not know or suspect they were lending taxpayer money for questionable degrees at questionable institutions? 
In closing, I also want to know why the federal government does not extend these loans to every American who wants to go to college?  President Biden and Senator Sanders along with others have talked about free community college.  If students do well in high school, community college is already essentially free.  I do not know why all Americans who wish to go to school after high school cannot apply for these loans.  The government has a better chance of people actually repaying their loans if everybody got to use them and the revenue generated would be more significant and helpful than is has been up to this point.  There are many working people who can afford to repay their loans who wish to got to college part time who will benefit from lower rate student loans and the repayment programs offered to current students.

First, if student loans were placed in forbearance, and NO payments were due, ANY payment a student or parent made ON the loans, during that period, SHOULD HAVE GONE 100% to the PRINCIPAL and NOT to the INTEREST. MOHELA is not doing this. When you make even an EXTRA PAYMENT during the same month, they are taking out INTEREST, versus paying the ENTIRE amount of EXTRA monies to the principal.

When loan were taken out, we were told XXX amount of dollars loaned, would cause XXX amount of payments to pay the loans off. THAT should have been the payment, with the loans decreasing, NOT increasing year after year, when payments were made on time. 

In 2019, I paid my student loan EVERY MONTH. At year's end, I paid $3643.50. The amount that went to principal was $394.95. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!

THIS is why everyone is so upset. We're making payments, even when they are not due, due to forbearance and loan holder's mistakes, but they're taking teaspoons of dirt out of the mountain of loans, not shovelful!

If CONGRESS could have their PPP loans FORGIVEN, and those States that objected to PUBLIC Student Loan Forgiveness does not have a problem with THAT; then REVERSE their FORGIVENESS also, and make them pay back their loans, like many Americans are having to repay.

Yes, it's true some people didn't go to college, and some paid off their loans, but that has nothing to do with the people who are paying loans right now. The economy is not raising wages, yet prices continue to go up. People are working more hours yet making the same money.

I'm not asking anyone to look out my window, just respect my view from it....

President Biden, you said people with student loans would either qualify for $10,000 or $20,000 loan forgiveness IF ELECTED. We shook on that! 

We held up our end of the gentleman's agreement handshake. 

NOW, it's time for YOU, to hold up YOUR END, of the handshake.","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,

If all else fails at least  make forgiveness not subject to taxes permanently whereas when students start getting forgiveness years from now via original income driven repayment they aren't hit with 50k in taxes. Also, expelling the interest would be a happy medium too, that's a effort! I have interviewed for jobs making $85k a year but since graduation 14 years ago never received job offer likewise. I get jobs I could have done out of high school making $10-15 a hour tops. When one takes mortgage they live in house, or get car loan for car they ""use"" and drive every day. On other hand with the education I have, I have nothing that I use. It's like owing money on house I don't even have. Additionally, can't get credit, can't buy house, can't finance new automobile, everyone say no because debt to income ratio too high, yet my credit score was 760. If I was afforded opportunity to give up my credentials i.e. degree (I finished grad school), in return for forgiveness I wouldn't even think twice. Perhaps that's something you guys could introduce also. I made maybe $27k last year with graduate level degree. The main debate is you should be accountable for what you took out, but this isn't the same, as mentioned in the latter it would be different if I were driving a car everyday I took auto loan on in that case no forgiveness would make sense as your actually using it, with education I was told by everyone take the loans, you will get good paying job which never happened. Almost no employer has ever cared about my degree, I am getting older, it's been 14 years since graduation, and I am financially in poverty or below. College is the new high school we different avenues to prepare people for jobs, degree inflation is real. I applaud this admin for taking steps in the right direction. It's a start. I owe $45k just in interest, which is around $20 a day! I am for student loan relief. I am buried because I believed what my teachers, parents, counselors, pretty much everyone said 14 years ago ""you'll be working at McDonald's without degree/education"" and here I am with master's degree working at McDonald's anyways! Let's not forget the system's flaw in giving money to young adults with no credit history or proven ability to pay it back, most all require ability to repay, credit score etc. I read something online the other day basically saying Jesus sacrificed so that our sin debt was forgiven yet the same people that live according that word want to fight against student's getting relief, that makes 0 sense. This summarizes my opinion on the matter. I say yes to forgiveness of all interest, yes to forgiveness for balances exceeding original amounts, financial hardship forgiveness and all other provisions listed. I emphasize at the very least make forgiveness exempt from taxes being counted as income on permanent basis.","Four-Year Public Institution of Higher Education",,,,,,

I do wish there was still a provision for those of us who received a Pell Grant, as the amount of my debt has not grown beyond my initial borrowing (I've been paying off interest each month), I have not made a significant dent in what I owe.

My wife decided to try for a pregnancy when we got news of the initial plan that would have given us almost $20,000 worth of debt relief, and she became pregnant before the SC overturned the original action. Perhaps an error in judgement on our part, but it felt like a glimmer of hope and opportunity when the original plan was made public. Now we're getting by, but it is very difficult, and we will be unable to buy a home or move out of our one bedroom apartment for the foreseeable future. We now have a son and are barely treading water, thanks to the Supreme Court slamming closed the door we'd thought had opened for us. I went back to school after my department was laid off during COVID, and am now working as a software engineer at half the average salary rate in my area (initially hired at $56k/yr) because I needed a source of income with a pregnant wife. Our one-bedroom apartment is $1,975/mo, and our health insurance is around $1,400/mo and now I have three mouths to feed. There is very little breathing room, and our savings was drained as we relied on it during my schooling.

Again though, while I'm bitter that the original plan was stopped, I am happy for those of us who will benefit from these actions. Thanks for fighting for us all, even if my family is not directly affected.","Individual",,,,,,

Many honorable careers have training that is not considered ""higher education."" Rather they require apprenticeships and on-the-job training for technical skills.
There is no rational basis for the government to forgive student loans as this rule dictates. Students entering college knew the costs of the education before they entered. They should have calculated that cost into the benefit of receiving a higher education degree - just as I did. If that degree would not pay for the cost of the higher education, they should have reasoned that it was not worth pursuing.
If the government forgives bad decision making for college loans when a student chooses a career that cannot repay and justify the cost of the higher education, the government will continue the cycle of poor decision making in regards to cost/benefit analysis of higher education.
I stand firmly against the US government forgiving student loans based on bad cost/benefit decision making by the loan bearers.","Student",,,,,,

First, thank you to President Biden for caring about this issue.
My wife and I have 3 kids and all went to college, at least initially.  Only our youngest has actually been able to continue with her higher education due to financial hardships our family has faced in our farming business these past few years.  Our oldest daughter has accumulated almost $30,000 in student loan debt and has not been able to finish her education due to inability to pay while not working enough hours and some mental health issues.  The debt is overwhelming to her.  This causes even more mental health problems for her, like spiraling down into a deep hole.  The only hope she has of ever overcoming this debt is this forgiveness program.  Only then will she be able to finish her degree and get out there to increase productivity.
Our middle child, our son, went to college for over a year but ended up having to postpone due to financial hardship.  He absolutely had to take a full time job to help the family survive.  He is still stuck waiting on the opportunity to fulfill his potential with a degree one day, but will never bet the chance with the $22,000 student loan debt looming over him like an albatross.  He was finally sued by the state of texas and we helped him to set up enough assets and co-signed with him for a bank loan to pay that off to avoid being prosecuted by the great moral paragon of Texas integrity, Atty. Gen. Ken Paxton.  His only hope of ever seeing daylight for his hopes and potential to become actual opportunities is some kind of loan forgiveness like this federal program pushed by President Biden.  This one singular issue will make more actual difference in many hundreds of thousands of lives in the future generations of common people in this nation than any other issue on the table currently.  As a result of President Biden's concern for this emergency issue, this conservative Texas family WILL be voting for President Biden's return to the White House this fall.  We want to see another four years of this kind of care and concern for real-world public policy that actually helps real people and not just the wealthy all the time.
Thank you.","Other",,,,,,

It is necessary and important to help people who are drowning in student loan debt. As a Millennial, I have watched the government bail out banks, car manufactures, airlines, and most American businesses with PPP ""loans."" If the US can assist massive corporations when they get into financial trouble, then we should also assist regular people. The student loan crisis was caused by state governments withdrawing funding from public education and many decisions made by previous federal administrations who cut education funding, set high interest rates for student loans and saw student loan borrowers as cash cows.  

Some people argue that it's not fair to bail out student loan borrowers because people who didn't go to college don't get the same assistance, but that's not entirely true. If someone who didn't go to college acquires $100,000 in credit card debt, they can get it discharged through bankruptcy. That has not been an option for student loan borrowers for decades. There is no way to escape student loan debt if you can't afford to pay it except by dying. 

I don't think people understand how student loan borrowers have been lied to and mislead by the government, universities, and student loan servicers. At every turn, I was told this was ""good"" debt, and that I would be able to get a job that would allow me to easily pay off my debt. That college was worth the cost and that I had no choice if I wanted to work in my chosen field of Education. Once I graduated I found I could not get a salary anywhere near what I needed to successfully pay off my loans. 

I have worked in public service and served three AmeriCorps terms since graduating. But I was given terrible advice by AmeriCorps and my loan servicer and put my loans in Forbearance for three years when I should have been on an income-based repayment plan. It's only because of the Biden Administration's PSLF waiver that I will get PSLF this year after 10 years of public service. 

It is a huge relief to see my loans forgiven and I believe everyone who was mislead should have the same opportunity. This proposed program will help so many people get out from under massive debt that they never should have had to take on in the first place. It will stimulate the economy. When I realized my loans would be forgiven this year, I was able to buy a new car with the extra money I had after my loan payment was lowered through SAVE.  

Please keep fighting for those of us who were lied to and mislead by universities and loan servicers. No one should have to live with massive debt they have no hope of paying off in their lifetime.

Having all A’s and ready to submit for reimbursement for the student loans I took up front, my employer exercised their option to forfeit the reimbursement program citing economic downturn and another $12,000 was added to my loans.

I would have paid my loans off already if the interest did not eat over 80% of my monthly payment!

My daughter hasn't gone back to college after completing her 1st year cause she owes the college money and she wanted to be a marriage/Childerens counselor and now it's on hold. Going back to me yes I made a choice in a career one that I can be proud of and help people massage is not luxury it's a have to people with Aches and pains gets relief from massages.

I pay and pay and pay and the amount owed goes up and up and up. Over $100,000.00. How is this fair? Please make it make sense. I am not even able buy a home because my debt to ratio is too high all because of a loan I believed would better my livelihood.  I have never been so stressed. 
Some of the ideas in this proposal make sense, but what about the students in my state now receiving a free ride to college for 4 years if they are a NM resident. I would have qualified. Born and raised.

President Biden has no constitutional authority to forgive student loan debt.   He has acted alone, bypassing congress, and in defiance of U.S. Supreme Court rulings.

Transferring this enormous debt to them is a slap in the face, and shows a complete disregard for responsible financial stewardship of taxpayer funds.   Our monumental national debt shows that this program, along with many others, is something we can simply not afford.

Mr. President:

     Thank you for this opportunity to respond to a National crisis.  My education is primarily in Automotive.  The student loan that is in question has been a miserable event to try and resolve

Working in an outpatient clinic with over 700 patients in Pasco County Florida (a major epicenter in itself) during the COVID-19 pandemic was no easy task. Keeping staff and patients safe was the primary goal, but assisting those who are already isolated due to their addiction proved the hardest task of all. We had to develop new ways to keep our patients engaged in treatment, preventing both mental health issues and overdoses. I am proud to say we were able to complete this challenge because of the diligence of an amazing team. This is a glimpse of the dedication and hard work I do on a daily basis.  My day starts at 3:30 am so patients can get to work, re-gain their self-esteem, and integrate back into the community. I chose this work because it is an integral part of who I am. I completed school late in life, graduating college at 50; all while working full time with my day beginning at 3:30am. Due to my learning disability, I needed to attend my classes in person as online courses were too much of a challenge for me. I also worked towards and received several credentials such as CAP (Certified Addiction Professional), HS-BCP (Human Services Board-Certified Practitioner) and CBHCMS (Certified Behavioral Health Case Manager Supervisor). Although I graduated from university with 3.8 GPA, I never received any scholarships, I had to take out loans. These loans have become difficult because working within the non-profit sector, the pay scale is lower than average. I could not afford to return for my master's degree as I would not be able to carry a bigger loan. I applied for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness and did whatever I needed for repayment assistance. I was told that because of my changing payments (to make it more affordable at several times), my loan forgiveness did not count as much as it should have. This was with the older loan facilitator. I feel defeated and now that I am looking at retirement not long into the future, I have no idea how this would ever be repaid with a fixed income. I have dedicated my life to serving the most vulnerable population, and although I would not have changed anything, the burden of a large repayment looms over me. If I dedicated my life to work 13 years within the non-profit sector, I feel that my government has let me down. I have raised my children to believe in the importance to serve others, that is why my oldest son proudly serves as a United States Marine for the past 17 years. This loan forgiveness would be life-altering for me and in a way, it would make me feel as if financially and being compliant with what my government said, would be a reward for that dedication. Then I could find a way, when retirement does come, find another capacity to serve others through volunteering. Because that's what's it's all about in life, serving others.

I am currently on the IDR program. My original loan amount owed was $34,000 and doubled over the years.

As of today, my loan only reflects when it was consolidated to direct loan. as if the years of payment are non-existent.

I, may years ago, had to borrow for student loan money. I agreed to repay the borrowed money and had to, over many years with my Mother's assistance, repay the money, AND REPAID all the borrowed money for student loans.

During that time my wife and I put 4 kids through college. We took advantage of grants and scholarships when available but in the end, we paid over $100,000 so our kids could graduate. Much of that sum came from loans. It took almost 20 years, but we eventually paid off every single cent. My oldest son graduated and then joined the US Marine Corp after 9/11. We got ZERO help with his loans, only to freeze them during his time in the service yet interest piled up with no relief. MY oldest daughter became a Police Officer. We received no help at all with her college debt. My youngest son became a Fire Rescue Paramedic and again, we paid for his entire college experience with no assistance from any entity at all. I'm not complaining about all this, in fact I am proud that we were able to accomplish this mission on our own without burdening anyone else. These were choices we made, and we got the job done. Now, this current administration in its efforts to buy votes wants to saddle us with taxpayer obligations to pay college expenses for others. Not only is that not fair, but SCOTUS has ruled in unconstitutional. Congress holds the purse strings; the President has no authority to use taxpayer money in this fashion. Why is this all about college? Why aren't we talking about trade school debts? The answer is simple, college degrees are no longer financially viable while trade schools teach valuable skills that are financially rewarding. So now the President wants to reward college students who made poor choices so that they will vote for him and his party. This is nothing more than a political ploy that will contribute to our countries financial down fall. Rescind the program.

Some of these students are first time college entrants in the family. These students are hoping for a better life, better income, planning for a future.. reaching a dream job. 
The citizens of the United States can complain all they want about NOT MY DEBT... The Government takes from us everyday, they tax us until we can't be taxed anymore... Taxes on income, taxes to buy products FROM overseas with our taxed income, then paying more taxes during tax season. 
When I took out my loans back in 2002 to start my journey (which should have been 4 years) I ended up with $52K in loans by the time 2016 came around. This is after 2 loans were garnished during a VERY bad time in my life trying to raise my son on one income (serving food and bartending). The program curriculum changed three separate times during the first program I entered. All I wanted was the two year degree then transfer the credits to the 4 year college. I ended up with worthless degrees and now am self-taught with two jobs trying to raise my daughter and send my son money. His Father passed away in 2019. My loans.. now are at over $80K. They have been transferred four times, consolidated (off of suggestions at the time from lenders), garnished, interest went from 3.4% up to now 6.25%.. I will be dead before these loans are paid off and I WILL NEVER OWN A HOME... EVER!!! My children will live just as how I did growing up, poor and I am working two jobs. I'm not taking hand-outs, I'm not flipping burgers complaining that I want my loans wiped out. I fully understand the ramifications. We are facing those right now from the covid handouts (inflation), its paying all that back. 
I just want some relief so MAYBE I can give my children a life they deserve, I know I won't get that life, but they need it.","Individual",,,,,,

When a borrower received loans for attendance in a program or at an institution that has since lost access to Federal aid because it failed to meet required student outcomes standards, was subject to an action by the Secretary due to failing to provide sufficient financial value or closed after failing required student outcomes metrics or the initiation of a Secretarial action process.

I did not go to college because I could not afford to. I think it is arrogant to think people who did not attend college should be responsible for paying off someone else's loans. My tax dollars should not go to people who decided to take out loans but can't pay them now. It is unfortunate that there are people who are still paying on THEIR loans after 20 years but that is THEIR responsibility, not mine. Our government, regardless of which party is in power has wasted enough taxpayer money on programs that only benefit them. Take care of the homeless veteran's first!

If I had a Federal Student Loan I would qualify for loan forgiveness through my Federal employer but since I have a private student loan I am ineligible for any such assistance.

I would like to request that the administration create a program that allows those who hold private student loans to consolidate into a Federal student loan. This would ensure that those with private student loans would receive the same benefits as those who hold a Federal student loan.

Overall, I am pleased with President Biden's great effort at relieving this insurmountable debt for so many Americans. President Biden truly cares about students and we are all blessed that he is our President. ","Federal Agency",,,,,,

Thank goodness for PSLF (and for recent changes that eliminate the income tax on forgiven loans) but the fear is that if Trump gets elected he will install someone to oversee the Education Department who will strive to  invalidate or obstruct her forgiveness, as she will reach 120 payments in the next administration.

The media coverage around this matter tends to falsely portray the student loan holders as trying to get a free ride.  If other loans were structured and administered the way this program has operated people would understand that these are not like ordinary loans. The system has been broken and President Biden is attempting to fix it.  Anyone with these loans knows that to be true.

I would like to urge the President to continue this long overdue work to correct a broken system.

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my disagreement with the concept of widespread student loan forgiveness. While the intention behind such proposals is undoubtedly noble – to alleviate the burden of debt on individuals – I believe that it is not the most effective or equitable solution to the issue at hand.

First and foremost, student loan forgiveness may seem like an appealing quick fix, but it fails to address the root causes of the problem. The skyrocketing costs of higher education, coupled with the lack of sufficient financial aid and support systems, are the real culprits behind the student debt crisis. Simply wiping away existing debts does not tackle these systemic issues, and without addressing them, we risk repeating the same cycle of debt accumulation in the future.

Furthermore, blanket forgiveness disregards the principle of personal responsibility. While many individuals struggle with student debt due to circumstances beyond their control, such as economic hardship or predatory lending practices, there are also those who knowingly took on loans without fully understanding the implications. It would be unfair to absolve everyone of their debts indiscriminately, especially at the expense of taxpayers who may not have had the opportunity to pursue higher education themselves.

Moreover, widespread student loan forgiveness could have unintended consequences for the economy as a whole. The sudden elimination of billions of dollars in debt could disrupt financial markets and lead to long-term repercussions, such as inflation or a reduction in the availability of credit for future borrowers. This could ultimately harm the very individuals that such policies aim to help, particularly if it results in higher interest rates or limited access to loans for essential purposes like buying a home or starting a business.

Instead of focusing solely on forgiveness, I believe we should explore more targeted and comprehensive solutions to address the student debt crisis. This could include measures such as expanding access to affordable education, increasing funding for need-based financial aid programs, and implementing reforms to make loan repayment more manageable, such as income-driven repayment plans.

In conclusion, while the idea of student loan forgiveness may seem appealing on the surface, I believe that it is not the most effective or equitable solution to the underlying issues of the student debt crisis. We must instead focus our efforts on addressing the root causes of the problem and implementing reforms that will provide long-term relief for borrowers while ensuring the sustainability of our higher education system.

Sincerely,
Daniel Geddes","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,

I realize it is rough but millions have paid off their loans while working two or more jobs.  I for one paid my loan off completely.  Why?  Responsibility.  I incurred the debt and fully understood it was a debt I was responsible for.  I did not use the loan money for spring break, car, food, clothes, etc.  I used it to pay for tuition knowing full well I had to pay it back. My wife and family did without while we paid my debt.

As a fair person, I would like to offer an alternative.   One way to approach this would be to provide low-interest loans to those borrowers who took the debt and for them to pay off the debts themselves.

I still hold over 10k in loans and have been paying on my loans for almost 20 years. If I would have had the money like some people I've known who paid their loans off early, I would have. This obviously helps the middle class. For those who claim it is unfair or ""socialist,"" this is what helping the middle class is about.

In the last 10 years I have been a victim of 2 mass layoffs, a company that cut pay for myself and other departments after 4 years of service and now I work for a company that hasn't given me a raise since I started in 2020 (even with the inflation we have all experienced). While, I am barely middle class with a Bachelor's degree from a good university. 

When people say the middle class is dead, I tend to agree, but I do not necessarily blame government on that other than complete deregulation which allows wealthy individuals and companies take advantage of the system (2008 crash). It is obviously leaders of companies who make the decisions to keep people or not raise pay while they are still getting their high income and bonuses. Elon Musk's 56 billion pay package with Tesla while laying off workers is an example. I am not against capitalism but total deregulation is like having a Final Four with no referees. Accountability and some regulation is necessary. 

Raising taxes for the wealthy and corporations (especially for those corporations who do not pay much tax anyway i.e. Trump Org) is a good way to help with our deficit and can help pay for forgiveness in student loans for middle class people burdened with debt. 

I wish people would see this as a way to help the economy and the average person, and not just bitterness towards the government for ""giving out free money."" There are grants(free money) and other options that companies receive as well as many tax breaks. 

Even though I do not think this particular program will benefit me, I do feel that the benefits to the average person in debt far outweighs any issue with the deficit or the claims of socialism and so-called free money.

Millions of Americans including me took out student loans and have paid them off. This decision to take a loan is one that each person has to make. They take on this obligation when they accept the loan. You now want to let these people to lie about paying it back. Not to mention those that have paid them. Are you going to reimburse those people that have paid them off? using my tax dollars there should be a payback to me. If you are not going to pay back those that have already paid them off, then you have no right to pay it for others. those that have paid off their loans did so at great cost. they had to sacrifice to pay the loans.
You are using tax dollars to pay the loans off. what authority are you using to do this? A secondary education is not necessary to live. this is an option that is good for some. Since this is not a necessity why should all Americans pay for another's choice? This seems to be another welfare program. Yet there is not test for financial need. the very wealthy will not have to pay anything for this optional activity.
We have military veterans that live on the street. These people gave up their lives to support the United States. They have to fight a bureaucracy that is hostile towards them and makes them prove that they were injured during their time in the service of our country. No one has taken any interest to ensure that anyone that was in the service automatically get compensation for their time. Contrast this with paying a person's student loan where they were at no jeopardy. A student does not put their lives at risk. A student has done nothing to farther the power of the United States. A veteran is just sent on his way with nothing. 
There are lot of people that need help. Students are not the only ones that need a handout.  Housing is so expensive. Hard working Americans cannot afford to rent or buy a home. They cannot not in some cases get a break on their taxes for the interest on the loan. What good is an education when you cannot afford a place to live?
There are more examples of people that have need. unless you are going to spread the tax dollars to all then you should not do it for the people that least need it. Using tax dollars on a welfare system that has not been approved by the people through their representative is not constitutional. This is another tax on hard working Americans that give relief to those privileged few that chose to go to secondary education. ","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,

I was the first one in my immediate family to go onto college as both of my parents were factory workers. I started with my associates degree, then my bachelor's, and finally my master's, all while taking out as much student loans as I could. During that time, I was in deferment due to financial hardship and in-school deferments. 

At the time, I was not educated on the IDR program and was encouraged to continue with deferments, which at the time seemed the best option as I matured, got married, bought a house, and started having kids. All those things that a young family already struggle with so adding student loans payments wasn't the top of our priority list.

After completing my master's, while still married, our income together made the 10% of our income IDR impossible so we continued to defer them.

Fast forward to 2016, I got divorced and I was able to start paying on my student loans. Now, I'm staring at the end of a barrel with knowing I have over $200,000 in student loans, $80,000 of that is interest! My student loans are 6%!

I know I owe these loans, I want to pay them but even the website doesn't show all the interest that has accumulated on my loans, currently only shows $15,000 in interest but because I consolidated my student loans in 2012, all this interest was added back to the principle.

I understand helping people with lower incomes, that is great for them, however, I am an upper middle class white woman, with a good career, and two kids that are going to be heading to college soon. I DON'T want them to end up in my same situation, I've worked so hard to be where I am today so that my kids have more opportunities than I had and I want to help them more than my parents were able to.

As upper middle class, I pay a ton of taxes, I volunteer in my community, I donate, I support our economy, just as others in my position do. We support for the lower class and the upper class the burdens that always fall on our shoulders, yet we get left behind.

What I would like to see are:

1) The website should display ALL the interest accumulated on student loans, even after consolidation.
2) Forgive ALL interest accumulated since the first loan taken out.
3) Reduce interest rate to 0% or 1%
4) IDR at 5% of your income for ALL levels of degrees
5) Forgive separate loans as they age. So for example, my associate's degree is 20 years old, forgive those loans so I can start putting more money towards my advanced degrees.","Financial Aid Administrator",,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/ED-2023-OPE-0123-27111/attachment_1.pdf",

I'd like to begin by saying this is a worthless and shallow gesture. It is the cutting off your nose to spite your face. You and your administration are failing to address the root of the problem, the issuance of student loans and the cost of higher education. When we are fully grown, beyond college, and seeking loans for any number of items, our credit is assessed. This is done to provide a measure of risk to the lending institution so they are able to make an informed decision with regard to their lending practices. They do not grant loans to anyone. Some of the largest loans Americans will ever be capable of taking, are ones for higher education. These loans should be borne out of the same level of due dilligence. Thought and care should be exercised when these loans are given to students. This is an obvious fact yet it bears repeating because your administration is completely ignoring it.

Next, the cost of attending college for a degree has risen out of control. Most colleges receive some level of government subsidy. Yet the student cost of these same colleges appear to have ballooned out of control. Even going to some cheaper institutions, saddle graduates with tens of thousands of dollars in debt. These debts accrue high interest and are unforgiveable through bankruptcy. Nearly every other debt can be removed through bankruptcy, except student loans. Men and women are forced to pay monumental amounts, some nearly unpayable due to the sheer size.

Before you embark on a journey trying to help people, make sure what you're doing doesn't harm others. More importantly, make sure you address the root problem. You are simply removing money from part of the ledger while waiting a generation for it to build up again. Because college is still expensive, interest rates are still high, and bankruptcy still won't help.

Be better.","Other",,,,,,

We sold a house last year and made a big chunk payment on the remaining 2 fed loans I had. Instead of applying that payment to 1 loan and paying that one off, MOHELA split that evenly over both loans, paying off half of each. Had they applied it all to one (which they said couldn't be done online and we could never get anyone on the phone) then one would be paid off and the other would have shown that the balance is in fact greater than when the loan began.

The way that the payment was applied essentially made it look like the loan balance isnt bigger because of interest ",,,,,,,

People fresh from graduating college often do not have the wherewithal to pay the often substantial burden as they are trying to establish their lives independently in new careers, this means that the loans start accruing interest that can balloon their balance beyond affordability. This drain on their budgets keeps them from investing in things that will grow our economy. Buying a first home gets pushed into the future, having children is often financially unavailable, entrepreneurial investment is too risky and saving for retirement is put off to some future point, setting them up for struggling to save.

The economy grows when people fresh from their education can invest in America. Our government shouldn't be profitting from its citizens' indebtedness. Repayment honors the agreement that students made in taking loans, burdening them with interest goes beyond what is fair and forward-looking for our republic. ",,,,,,,

First, it teaches those receiving the forgiveness that they do not have to be responsible for their actions and promises. Second, it teaches those that work hard to uphold their obligations that they are responsible for the comfort of strangers and their hard work is not to be rewarded, but punished.
If we want to forgive debt, it would be a much better idea to forgive the debts of small businesses owners that work hard and EMPLOY tax payers!

Fairness - The administration is attempting to curry favor on very specific smaller group of people by transferring legally undertaken debts to a larger group that has not undertaken that debt and has not received benefit from it; discriminating against the larger public for the benefit of a few. 
Authority - The spending impact from these plans is significant; congress did not grant the authority needed to spend $billions of dollars above allocated budgets. 
Fiscal impact - The federal government annual deficit continues to grow, the accumulated debt has reached an all-time high, now with increased interest rates, debt service costs have soared.  It is long past time to reduce federal spending.  New spending programs, especially those that are completely non-essential and targeted to a minority of the population, cannot be sustained.     
Effect on higher education costs - The government loan programs that were enacted previously have helped increase the costs of higher education, continuing to expand the available money by ""forgiving"" large amounts will serve to further increase higher education borrowing and increase overall higher education costs.
Personal responsibility - Responsibility for personal actions is a cornerstone of proper human behavior, one must take accountability for the choices made in life and deal with the consequences.  Failure to understand how a legally issued loan and interest calculations work is not the responsibility for those of us who do understand, who accepted and repaid loans, found a way to get a higher education without loans, or who chose a career path that did not require a purchased higher education.

HOWEVER, I and many others who understand basic economics can clearly see that when the federal government guarantees loans for every person accepted into college (and lets be honest half of these young people really have no need to attend college) these institutions of higher learning have zero reason to try and keep costs low. Why would they? If the government simply keeps signing checks zero questions asked I would raise my prices as well. That is why their are often just as many 'administrators' at colleges as their are actual students. It is appalling.

I graduated in 2012 with about 60k undergrad student loan debt and the average interest of about 5% since that time through variable and refinanced rates. I am still paying roughly $800 a month and paid all the way through Covid.

I understood it was my debt and mine alone, and so too does every single person who accepts these loans.

Now that I am almost done paying over $100,000 in total I get the added bonus of a new and higher tax bill to cover the cost of 'cancelling' other peoples debt too? Why are they not expected to pay their own debts? When does the federal government sent me a check for all the debt I have already paid off? I am expected to sacrifice as a young adult to pay down my debt but others will simply have theirs 'cancelled'?

Again, even lowering the interest rate would help.  That has been the number one factor for most people. ","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,

I do not in any way or form support student loan forgiveness.  Those who signed for the loan are responsible for paying said loan.  I would however support reducing or erasing the interest but the principle must be paid.  Why should one specific group get relief when many right now are suffering from the inflation?

I attended college as well as graduate school and after working 12 years do not have any student loans remaining.  If you are planning on forgiving outstanding student loans, it would only be fair to refund timely submitted student loan payments, which I cannot see as economically tenable.

Last time I checked, this is still America where contracts mean something. People that take student loans know for what they are signing up -- no one forced them to sign up.

As evidenced by the chronic underemployment in the United States, we have a glut of college graduates.  Forgiving student loans will only set a precedent that encourages more people to try to attend college and, thus, only add to the student loan problem if they fail to graduate or add to the chronic underemployment issue if they succeed in graduating.

Student loan forgiveness is different from PPP loan forgiveness since everyone knew the PPP loans were going to be forgiven when they were issued.",,,,,,,

I am glad that this administration is attempting to do something to tackle the issue facing those being crushed under student debt.  I am fortunate enough that I can afford to pay back my loans and I am glad that others are able to get help with theirs.

It is obvious that the higher education system has run away on its costs.  $800 for a textbook that is online only, and the publisher isn't even really changing anything (very low overhead costs)?  They are leaching off a system that made it too easy for a young person to borrow as much money as they were told they needed. This is not free market; this is economic vampirism. 

The cost of a higher education has become a crazy symptom of a culture we created, that is too late to turn around now. We can't put that genie back in the bottle but keep trying.  I will continue to support these efforts. As a registered Republican, I will continue to support the investment in our youth, however that youth chooses to express itself.  I'll keep working on my party if you keep working on helping student debt relief and finding a long-term solution to the costs of higher education.

I agree strongly with the first part, it was worth it BUT it has not ""all worked out."" 

As a teacher, I am underpaid and overworked and within a system that requires more higher education and degrees in order to advance in the system and try to make enough money to raise a family. So I went back to school, got my masters, and still struggle to pay my bills. All of this leads me to my point. For a certain portion of our population the higher education system failed. It overpromised and underdelivered with it millions of people who are now trying to start families are now burdened with debt that is holding them back. I ask that the federal government assist these people in correcting an mistake and error that impacted an entire generation of people. Specifically these sections: 

""The outstanding balance of a loan for borrowers who would be otherwise eligible for forgiveness under an IDR plan or an alternative repayment plan but who are not currently enrolled in such a plan (§ 30.84).

The outstanding balance of a loan for borrowers determined to be otherwise eligible for loan discharge, cancellation, or forgiveness, but who did not successfully apply (§ 30.85).""

These sections would help me and my family out tremendously as we are both public servants who want to make our communities better.

The student loan forgiveness is complicated and anyone that isn't for it doesn't understand it or how it all began.  I watch the news and every now and then it's stated that this was part of the PSLF that was not complied with.  Yet it's much more complicated and people aren't listening.  You are trying to make them listen and applaud your efforts and support the loan forgiveness, not just for my benefit but to all who dreamed of higher education.

I come from a family of six children.  I am one of the youngest of five girls.  I was the first to graduate high school and pursue a college degree. My parents divorced and didn't not pay for my education and there fore I obtained on my own through the student loan process.  
I'm sorry that I even applied for the loans because they are never ending.  I'm not sorry for wanting to further my education to obtain a career that I enjoy, can help others and that I have been successful in.
Thank you for your time.  I support you and this decision for all student loan debiet.","Individual",,,,,,

While personal responsibility in financial matters is important, it is clear that the push for students to pursue a college education has led to excessive debt for millions of Americans. For decades, educational institutions have stressed the importance of obtaining a college degree. High school administrators, teachers and counselors have impressed their students with the idea that a college education is the only avenue to success. While it is true that further education holds value, millions of students have taken on excessive debt to obtain degrees that have offered no real chance for successful employment, much less the ability to earn enough income to repay loans and still afford to live modestly.

While interest rates on many educational loans have been fairly low compared to typical lending rates, they have not been low enough. There are multiple instances of small businesses getting significant loans with zero interest, often including tax exemptions for 10 years or more, when they start a new business. Students who endeavor to start their own career should be afforded similar benefits. 

When the United States claims that it has the money to send billions of dollars to Israel, Ukraine and many other countries, there should be no statements claiming that there is no money for debt relief for it's own citizens.","Federal Agency",,,,,,

First it attempts to ""forgive"" (read as: make taxpayers responsible for the debt willingly undertaken by individuals who received a benefit for the debt).  There would be an uproar if this administration was to ""forgive"" mortgages or credit card debt.  Like student debt, those aforementioned debts were willingly incurred by adults making financial decisions that they deemed beneficial to themselves.  This administration does NOT have the lawful authority to break, nullify or otherwise dispose of a legally binding contract between the lender and the individual.  As previously stated in court decisions, the power to do this resides in Congress and not through the stroke of a pen on an executive order. 

Secondly, although it was clear to all during this administration's first attempt at ""forgiveness"", it is more than abundantly clear to the public after the Supreme Court ruling, that this is nothing more than a pathetic, outrageous attempt to bribe individuals for their votes.  This administration is taking on water fast and is desperate to try to garner favor from a small demographic of people.  This fails miserably when one looks at it through the equal protection clause.  They are trying to foist upon people who have taken out loans and paid them back, as well as those who went into the trades or for any other reason did not take out student loans, the debt of those who made poor choices in their lives or studied useless topics and are now shocked that they cannot actually earn money with their useless degree.

This administration must stop these poorly veiled attempts to bribe people for their votes.  It is morally, ethically and legally wrong.  But certainly not out of the ordinary based on the actions this administration has taken over the last three years. ","Student",,,,,,

I accomplished this goal and dream but the financial burden has affected my life significantly. I feel it is important to look to the past and the present to determine financial hardship. I was eligible for the Pell grant every year in which I was in college which demonstrated my income level on lack of assets that I would have post graduation. I have secured a job but not in my field of study due to no fault of my own so I am not actively using my degree. I ask that your administration examine financial hardship not only in the present, but to take a wider snapshot of a person's life during their time as a college student. I believe Pell grant recipients during their college career should be eligible for the full $20,000 in forgiveness regardless of current income level and be designated under the financial hardship umbrella of your student loan forgiveness plan's final draft.

And while your proposed programs will aid many, there are others of us who this will not help.  In my case, I am 55 years old. I went back to school as an adult and obtained my Bachelor's degree to better my future career and earning potential. I am also in the PSLF program as I work in healthcare at a non-profit hospital. I will likely not payoff my student loans before I retire as I have not been paying the required number of months to qualify for forgiveness. 

I believe that other programs of forgiveness would better serve the public, and make a substantial impact:
1.  Forgiveness for older students/graduates, over 40 or over 50, regardless of how long they have had the debt.
2.  Forgiveness for all individuals in the PSLF program, without the required 10 years of repayment or 
3.  Forgiveness for all individuals in the PSLF program who work in healthcare.  COVID all but destroyed our organizations and our workforce - which have not rebounded. We are still struggling. Recognition for those of us who stuck it out is important. 

The proposed forgiveness of ""the full amount by which the current outstanding balance on a loan exceeds the amount owed when the loan entered repayment for loans being repaid on any Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plan if the borrower's income is at or below $120,000 if the borrower's filing status is single or married filing separately, $180,000 if a borrower files as head of household, or $240,000 if the borrower is married and files a joint Federal tax return or the borrower files as a qualifying surviving spouse (§ 30.81)"" does not reach all those it needs to.  Having a balance above the original amount owned indicates to me that payments may not have been made by some of those individuals, where I have FAITHFULLY made all payments and on time. Where is the reward for those of us who have never been delinquent?

The HEA clearly authorized the administration to forgive debt, as any aid administrator or politician who has completed proper training should know, and even though the US DOE chose to take the unnecessary step of going through the negotiated rulemaking process, a revamp to the student loan programs and loan forgiveness is long overdue.

While there are many who hold fast to the argument that they did not sign up for student loans so it is unfair to provide this relief to those that did, I was raised to believe that every child should have a better life than their predecessors, which is what these rules propose to do. Just because I experienced hardship does not mean I wish it upon others.

Further, although these rules do not directly address the cost of college, which is something that should be reconsidered by mandating a return to original levels of state funding as of the time of the creation of land grant institutions, they do a lot to prevent the current student debt crisis from expanding or reoccuring. By putting a halt to runaway interest, holding loan servicers accountable for their deceptive and fraudulent practices, taking control of the PSLF and TEACH programs to ensure they are being administered properly, and creating income-based repayment options that do not result in increased loan principals, the changes this administration is making to the student loan programs are on the right track to putting and end to this mess.

Another argument against student debt forgiveness is that the benefit of the education is only for those that earn it, however this could not be farther from the truth. It is and has been long recognized that the more education a general population has, the higher its quality of living, and the more opportunities for social and economic advancement. Other countries successfully ascribe to this model, as did the United States when it passed the Morill Land-Grant acts that effectively began its higher education systems, which are coveted world-wide.

While there is much work to be done, these adjustments and options for forgiveness stand to make enough meaningful change that current and future students will not be deterred from seeking to improve their knowledge and thereby better themselves, their communities, and the country as a whole.","Financial Aid Administrator",,,,,,

I want to bring to your attention the circumstances of physicians that work at IPA (independent private administrator) also called GMP (Grupos Medicos Primarios/ Primary Medical Group) Where Medicaid patients receive treatment in Puerto Rico.  These places do not fall under 330, nonprofit, government agency therefore physicians are not eligible for public loan forgiveness. Although health care is center to Medicaid patients and physicians’ payments is low with no benefits or few benefits at all.  Physicians’ choices to increase salary are either attempt private practices or migrate to U.S.A. continent.  I have been working in them for around 7 years approximate and so are the circumstances.  I have considered to file the public loan forgiveness marking the fact that is not a government agency and see what happens thou.

I just have some notes. To be honest, this isn't the first letter I've have written asking for help, but perhaps it'll be the last. 

I believe that it's important for our country for many reasons - It's a huge impact on many families around the country - a benefit that doesn't really need to be explained, here. 

Though I know how settling my debt would effect my life, I'm unable to imagine it actually becoming a reality. I had worked for the government for over 14 years (much of this went toward qualifying payments - I have 8 years of qualifying payments. I became unwell and left my job.) and I'm now working for a job that may be considered a qualifying employer. Now that I am in the SAVE plan, I have hopes that my debt will be forgiven.

I took out individual loans, each under 12k, and have now reached an excess of over 6K in debt I did not originally apply for - I have not made a dent in the debt I incurred so many years ago - and probably never will. My mother and father (both retired government employees) took out student loans for my sister and I - and transferred those loans to a private company because of the issue with crushing interest payments. The monthly payments are now higher than the day she did this. 

I started my own business about a month and a half before the pandemic hit the USA. I took out a COVID EIDL loan - I am being crushed with debt from this as well. With mortgage payments, a failed business, student loans - life has ground to a halt. 

Like many in this country, our family is struggling with student debt - and we will never see the end. This is an extremely important measure that the Biden Administration is taking, and perhaps this time around me and my family will benefit. ","Student",,,,,,

Over the past few years, we have seen too many nurses, respiratory therapists, and other medical professionals leave bedside care for other fields. 

Some of this exodus can be attributed to the income-to-cost-of-living ratio for bedside healthcare providers. I strongly believe those who devote their lives to caring for others should be considered for student loan forgiveness programs. 

I have been attempting to earn my master's degree for years, taking breaks to raise young children, go through a divorce, and lose my Air Force veteran son to suicide. At this point, I owe more than I borrowed and will likely be paying off my loans for the rest of my career. 

The stress and financial implications of student debt are preventing me from moving forward in my life. I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. While I'm not perfect, I know I am a great nurse and love being a nurse. However, this looming debt over my head makes me regret my decision to enter this profession.

I hope you will consider expanding student loan forgiveness programs to include hardworking healthcare providers like myself. Our industry depends on recruiting and retaining talented individuals, and this issue impacts far too many. ","Financial Aid Administrator",,,,,,

I believe this is the best solution for the following reasons:  

1. It encourages debtors to work, earn income, and provide value to the economy.
2. It lessens the financial burden on debtors and reduces the repayment time.
3. Debts are repaid and not forgiven which will be more fair to those that have already repaid their debts.  This will also reduce or eliminate tax-payer outrage.
4. It encourages current or soon to be students to select valuable degrees that will produce a good income whereas forgiveness encourages students to take on new debt for useless degrees like they have in the past.

Another useful debt relief measure would be to reduce the interest rate on outstanding federal student loans.

Students today expect to attend fancy, expensive schools, and then expect others who were unable to have these opportunities to pay their bills.  This is just plain wrong to individuals such as myself who acted responsibly and lived within their means.  It is even more unfair to those Americans who never even attended college, or who have honored their student debts, and are now expected to pay the bills for those who refuse to accept responsibility for their decisions.

I would ask the Education Department to use this opportunity as a teachable moment, and not force other Americans to bail out these privileged few.

I pen this letter with a heavy heart and a deep sense of disillusionment. It is with grave concern that I address the inadequacies of the recent relief plan rolled out by your administration. I cannot mince words nor soften the gravity of the situation at hand. The current relief plan falls far short of its intended purpose and fails to meet the needs of those it purports to assist.

Allow me to express my profound dismay at the series of broken promises and misleading assurances that have characterized this administration's approach to governance. Time and time again, we have been subjected to lofty rhetoric, and promises of transformative change from Biden's administration, only to witness a stark reality where the most vulnerable among us are left behind, their hopes shattered and their trust betrayed.

The promises made during the campaign trail have lost their luster, obscured by the harsh light of reality. It is disheartening to witness a pattern where the pursuit of votes seems to eclipse the genuine commitment to meaningful action. The relief plan, touted as a beacon of hope for millions, has proven to be a mirage, leaving in its wake a trail of broken dreams and shattered expectations.

What is particularly distressing is the manner in which eligibility criteria have been manipulated, rendering countless individuals who were once deemed eligible now excluded from assistance. The only ones who seem to garner any help are those who have already paid into the system for 20 years or those burdened by interest, not every borrower like before. This arbitrary exclusion has left millions stranded, their livelihoods hanging by a thread, and their belief in the promise of government assistance shattered beyond repair.

I implore you, Mr. President, and esteemed members of your administration, to heed this clarion call for urgent reassessment and corrective action. The time for half-measures and political maneuvering has passed. The only acceptable course of action is to rectify this egregious oversight and ensure that relief reaches EVERYONE not just a selected minority and without exception or delay.

We cannot afford to squander this opportunity for genuine change, nor can we allow the specter of political expediency to tarnish the noble ideals upon which this administration was elected. The stakes are too high, the consequences too dire to ignore.

In conclusion, I urge you to act swiftly and decisively in rectifying the shortcomings of the relief plan. The American people deserve nothing less than your unwavering commitment to their well-being and prosperity. Anything less would be a betrayal of the trust placed in you by the electorate now or come November.

The time for action is now. Lives hang in the balance; futures are at stake. Let history remember this moment as one where courage prevailed over complacency, where leadership triumphed over political expediency.

Regards, a U.S. Citizen and Student loan borrower strapped in debt and no chance of help with this new plan. Arthur Chaney","Individual",,,,,,

You have never offered relief for any of this and do not intend to. These burdensome loans also affect parents, many can now not retire or have insufficient retirement saving as a result. If you are offering relief for couple who make up to $180,000 you should offer to parent who has the same income level relief. Also, All of these students have had 3 years of no payments and should have been able to save or plan for repayment. There should in no way be any relief.

I believed it caused me to delay other major purchases like a car, house, and even having a family because of this crushing debt. 
Unlike other types of debt this is a life long commitment. (Till Death) If someone defaults on there Morgage, car loan, credit cards they can just claim bankruptcy and all is forgiven. With student loans there is no financial escape. 
I think if this actually takes effect it will be a positive change in my life and I can continue to save and make necessary life purchases that actually stimulate our economy. 
Instead of the constant worry of being crushed by student loan debt and out of control compound interest that make it seem like I will die with student loan debt. ","Other",,,,,,

The only condition listed that should qualify for debt relief is if the institution of higher learning is found to have fraudulent credentials or the lender has engaged in fraudulent lending practices. Millions of Americans, my family included, have saved, sacrificed, and worked to minimize outstanding debt while in college and/or done the same to send our children to college. Then we paid off our debt, once again sacrificing short term gratification to honor obligations that were freely accepted and should have been understood when they were incurred.

The costs of a college education have increased dramatically over the past 2 decades, but this proposed program does nothing to address that issue. In fact, this proposal, according to numerous studies, will most likely result in institutions of higher learning increasing their prices even more since they expect the Federal government (and by extension all American taxpayers) to provide financial relief. This puts an unfair and undeserved burden on taxpayers who either paid off their obligations or did not attend college at all and will make millions of Americans question why they should bother paying off their mortgages, their auto loans and I daresay even their income taxes if the federal government can just arbitrarily forgive debt for certain preferred classes of citizenry. I also have little faith in the costs presented in the proposed rule as the federal government typically overruns all cost estimates, which would shift even more burden to all Americans than the one already outlined in this proposed rule.

All the major universities collectively receive billions of dollars in endowments from outside sources annually. The Administration and the Department of Education should focus on reigning in college tuition increases and the types of majors offered, particularly at public universities. Prospective college students should also be educated before they leave high school in basic financial principles and the cost benefits in the marketplace of certain degrees, as many of the degrees offered currently have virtually no value in the economy from a livable wage standpoint. The United States, unlike other developed nations, does not advocate for citizens to consider trade careers such as plumbers, electricians, welders, nursing etcetera that provide Americans with a valuable and much needed skill they can utilize in the marketplace to earn a good living. Without a more comprehensive approach, the cycle will continue, and citizens will bear the burden once again at some point in the future.

After thorough examination of the proposed rule and in light of the comments above, one might reasonably conclude that this proposed rule is designed not as a real solution to an ongoing problem but as a political tool that is designed to pander to a specific voting block during an election cycle.

The idea was that this would allow me to get a good paying job and attain social mobility through a better career. My first job out of college paid $13 per hour at a drug testing lab. I saw positions at an Aldi paying $14 per hour, which didn't require a neuroscience degree. As time went on, the student loans required to complete my program created irreversible harms. Major life milestones were delayed because of the financial realities of student loans. I delayed marriage until my late 30s, was unable to afford a home until age 40 and now I am just preparing to have children at age 44. During these delays, my Mother passed away from cancer. As a result of this, my children will never meet their grandmother.

My student loans have made my life dramatically worse. Anything that can be done to prevent this from happening to anyone else is the right policy. I worked extremely hard to get my degree. Had I been lucky enough to live in some regions in Europe, I would have not only had zero loans, I would have been paid a stipend to attend college.

I support the proposed actions, but would like to see clarification on two points.

I understand that outstanding loan balances for people who entered repayment on or before July 2005 will be waived. Can i assume that this is a sliding timeline, i.e. if i entered repayment in January 2006, then i would become eligible for a waiver 6 months later? 

Second, there are many who did enter repayment, and at some point during the repayment period they became temporarily eligible for forbearance. Are such borrowers also eligible for the waiver?

The President does not have the authority to waive federal debt without congressional appropriation of funds. Even if this action obligates zero obligated funds outright, the administration and legal defense of the action does to a significant degree. If financial institutions are not actually paid directly, they will have losses to write off against taxes if they are not actually paid the contractual debt effectively reducing federal taxes received by the treasury which effectively restricts congress' ability to appropriate funds for necessary and appropriate functions of government. And, as most state and local taxes are based on adjusted federal income, the funds collected by these entities will also be reduced and will either reduce their ability to fund state and local programs or require infusion of federal funds at the direct expense of federal taxpayers. Further, as taxes collected are reduced, the general population of taxpayers will have to either pay more taxes or the government will have to increase its debt. Lastly, this action is a blatant and illegal vote buying/selling scheme that will increase the cost of higher education as historically the artificial infusion of government monies into a capitalistic system inflates the costs to people using the system.
As a former federal student loan borrower who has fully repaid his contractual agreement, I will personally be harmed by this action as I could have avoided several negative life consequences if I had been granted relief such as working multiple jobs, bankruptcy, technical homelessness, medical issues relating to increased work efforts necessary to pay my student loans, attendance at a for-profit institution that effectively limited employer acceptance, lower social security due to wage history, and decreased ability to save for retirement. I reserve the right to legal action against the Department of Education, its employees furthering and administering this action, and the president who issued the order Joseph R Biden (as presidential immunity for illegal actions is not certain, even after leaving office), and any other official, private or government involved in perpetrating this action that is illegal on its face.

I also was able to secure admittance to a graduate program, where as a student worker I made more money. After graduating with a master's degree I quickly got a job. In 4 years I was able to pay off my student loan debt. Mind you first time college student, matter of fact half of my extended family hadn't even graduated high school. 

You would think this would make me see the benefit of paying off others debt. But no, its morally wrong to pay for someone who took money from a well regulated lender. 

Why should I pay for my college debt and someone else's too?

The federal governemnt, specifically the federal reserve and lesser extent the executive office, is to blame for skyrocketing prices. All that you are told in public school is ""go to college"" which is directive from executive office on ""advancing america's youth"". So now its talked about that ""18 year olds don't understand the gravity of what they (loans) are taking"". If that's the case maybe public schools have failed them in decision making all around. Furthermore we are proposing not to pay for these debts with new money through taxation but simply by the federal reserve handing cash (via direct deposit) to the lenders. Which on its own will cause more inflation, which again will lead to rising costs for college.

If my measly master's of science attained brain can understand how terrible taking one person's money and giving to people who don't understand their value or simply don't want to pay back a promise then the unelected bureaucrat reading this can too, either way I end with my basic opinion below.

However, I would note that this does seem to leave those began repayment between 2005 and the enactment of the PAYE plan in an awkward position. I personally graduated into the 2008 financial crisis and was unable to make headway into loan repayment early on. As a result, I accrued significant interest on my loans that until the last few years, I was in no position to even consider addressing. Currently, after years of repayment in the IDR plan, I have accrued interest that is equal to 1/3rd of the total amount owed (i.e., principal, capitalized interest, and accrued interest). Although I would have fallen within the original $20,000 forgiveness program's income threshold, I now exceed the threshold for complete interest forgiveness under this proposed plan. If interest were forgiven I would be in a position to pay off the entirety of the debt in the next few years. But without that, it is difficult to swallow the fact that after more than a decade of on-time payments, I still owe significantly more than the amounts I took out. Again, I think that the program has a good targeted approach at addressing the student loan issue. It just appears that there may be a group just outside the complete loan forgiveness and complete interest forgiveness that was more adversely impacted by the economy at the time of graduation and the inability to access new student loan repayment programs (i.e., PAYE) and are heavily burdened by the capitalized and accrued interest on the loans, like myself, that would gladly pay off the loans if the full interest would be forgiven.",,,,,,,

I urge the administration not to move forward with this form of welfare. The Americans that took out these loans did this of their own free will and should be required to pay back their student loans as so many of us that have.

As a University of Missouri graduate with a degree in Vocal Performance in Opera, I currently carry approximately $70-80k in student loan debt, some of which is private. Coming from a background of poverty, I pursued this degree with the hope of achieving financial stability, only to discover post-graduation that the earnings prospects in my field are dismally low—averaging around $19k. Despite being promised that a degree would lead to a comfortable living, I've found myself struggling to make ends meet and unable to afford further career advancement opportunities due to additional program costs not covered by tuition. The classical music industry offers little upward mobility for impoverished singers, making it nearly impossible to achieve financial stability. I ask for loan forgiveness as this debt has become overwhelming, hindering my ability to start a family and impacting my financial well-being.

As a citizen burdened with student debt that has ballooned to an unmanageable level due to compound interest, I applaud your efforts to remedy the criminal amount of advantage that has been taken of myself and others by these institutions.

As an artist, I urge you to consider not simply educational programs that have closed in your pursuit of debt forgiveness and relief, but also programs that cannot ever make any promise of income of any kind to their students once a degree has been received. I am in over my head in debt for an MFA degree in performance. If you look at the numbers, the chance of earning a modest living as a performer, even without a degree, is not promising. Many of us have poured years of lives and hundreds of thousands of dollars (on top of interest) to pursue the life of a starving artist. Moreover, it becomes even more difficult to pursue the very thing we paid so incredibly for because we must commit ourselves fully to the pursuit of money in order to make our monthly payments and commit ourselves fully to any promise of forgiveness, such as taking a public service position with the hopes that maybe in a decade, if this program still stands, I can be released from this prison, and maybe then I can pursue the trade my degree trained me so well for. This country has been slowly suffocating any presence of artistry in its society over the last two decades. If there exists any administration that will bring it back to like, I trust that it is this administration. Please hear my plea.


Thank you.

I went back to school at 50 years old and wanted to get my skills up to get back into the field of office work after being a customer service rep for 10 years prior to that.  
I was so disappointed that the $20,000. student loan forgiveness did not go through.  

It would help me tremendously if we could do something for people like me that are older and retirement age to not have to worry about having to repay.  Especially when the interest would still accumulate if you were on the Income Driven program.

I would help tremendously if we could get relief.

As the cost of everything has risen since Covid, it has been very hard for me to make the payments.  It has put a huge financial burden on me, and I am sure many more Americans in my situation.

I've worked in the healthcare field for 23years and was at ground zero during the pandemic.  Life changed for everyone during that time.  I consider myself a patriotic tax paying citizen that happens to be of Latin ethnicity and am soon to be 63 years old.  As a young person I never ever thought that I would have an opportunity at higher education past high school. My education was a slow process as a working adult, but I currently hold a bachelor's degree and would have loved to go even further but time, money and current economic circumstances will probably not allow me to go beyond where I am, still I am grateful.   Covid forever has altered my dreams, and my future in the work force is getting shorter with every year that goes by. I would like to request that age also, be considered when reviewing new qualifications or guidelines for student loan assistance or cancellations.  I also feel that another option might be the lowering of interest rates to a maximum low so that student loan repayment might be more achievable for some, and more of a chance for loan servicers to receive at least the original loan amounts.  I do realize that there are different levels of needs for individuals and that some things that will work for some, may not work for others.  It is a difficult situation that we are faced with as a society.  Once again, I thank you for allowing my input however useful it might or might not be.  ","Institution of Higher Education",,,,,,

It will make a dramatic difference for most student borrowers! Thank you. One point of consideration: there is a dilemma that those of us who are actively trying to pay down our loans are faced with. We are not permitted to make ""extra"" payments to our principal before any accrued interest is fully paid off (ie: interest that has accumulated since the original date that our loan was taken out). At least, this is what Navient and Aidvantage, the two loan service providers who have serviced my student loans have required. So, for example, in my case, when I (responsibly) committed to paying down my loans during the pandemic's period of 0% interest + loan forbearance, I was only able to FIRST pay down thousands of dollars of interest. For perspective, this totaled to at least $20,000-$30,0000, due to the fact that my monthly interest totals to over $1000/month). This took almost two years to complete. Only THEN could I work towards putting overpayments towards my principal. My point is that, unfortunately, these new proposed loan forgiveness plans do not benefit individuals like me, as I now do not HAVE any additional interest left that has accrued from my original principal. In contrast, it seems that it would have been far better for me to have not made any payments during the pandemic/forbearance period and put the money to other uses (for example: childcare ($27,000+/year), mortgage payments ($1500/month), home repairs or improvements, car payments, saving for our children's college funds, etc.) 
For your consideration, I would like to propose that there be an amendment included in these new proposals that would allow for compensation for those borrowers who have already paid off or paid down a large portion of their interest. For example, this could apply to any amount of interest that was electively paid down by the borrower during the pandemic forbearance, allowing this amount to be ""forgiven"" from their total loan amount, up to the total amount of allotted forgiveness that all other borrowers could potentially receive. This would go a LONG way to ""reward"" those of us who have tried to ""do the right thing"" and remain consistent with our loan payments during the last few challenging years.

I started college in 2002 at the age of 17 when I signed my first promissory note for a $7,000 loan to pay for the first year of my education where books were $200 each, the university required me to live on campus (unless by special exemption), I had to add $2,000 on to a meal plan and have it all paid by the day I moved into the dormitory (2 weeks before school even started).  I have been paying on those loans on a graduated plan since then.  I've paid over $80,000 and I originally only borrowed $60,000.  I did have to put my loans in a deferment status for above 5 years because I could barely make ends meet after graduation in 2008 when the economy tanked. My then fixed rate loan's interest rate was adjusted from 2.5% to 6.5%.  In any other financial situation this would be considered predatory lending and illegal lending practices.

At this point I still have $65,000 in student loan debt that essentially is all interest.  Good people who have been trying to pay their debt back and who have been making their payments on time - every month, month after month need help. This is soul crushing to know you've paid back your debt and still have to pay more and the payment amount is enough to buy a new car, but instead you still drive the 12 year old vehicle you have because its paid off.  You skip the new brakes or new tires you need this month so you can make sure and pay your debt obligations.

The people need this, they need the help, they need the department of educations support.  A review of the entire program needs to be done because it is predatory lending for kids going into school and they feel they have no other choice but to take on this mountain of soul crushing debt just to get ahead in life only to be shackled and bound by this well into their 40s, 50s, and even 60s.","Other",,,,,,

As a Citizen of the United States I am empathetic for those challenged with the obligations they took on with Student loans. But the Federal government spending money that is adding to our massive long term national debt is not the answer for multiple reasons.

First, it is attempting to address the argument that is being made in this outreach document by the Department of Education that the cost of higher education is excessive and has outpaced inflation in other areas of the US'S economy. Paying off loans does not address the underlying problem. There have been many studies done that show that higher education spending (especially on salaries) and corresponding rates charged for degrees has directly correlated to the increased access to loans for the student population many of which was facilitated by government programs. Stop feeding the process with artificial stimulus and the institutions will have to modulate their demands on the population over time.

Second, these people choose to take on this obligation as countless others did but the majority of us sacrificed other things in their respective lives to pay of their debts.

Third, this is too selective, what about people who started a trade business and took on loans to pay for certifications and equipment. I don't see them getting a free ride. The government's role is not to pick winners and losers in this way just because they want to orchestrate a certain social behavior like advanced degrees.

As stated at the beginning, with servicing of our debt now approaching a trillion dollars a year with normalized rates by the Fed passing out money like it is buy one get one at the local grocery story is completely irrational. Doing the wrong thing for America and its population in the long term with a horrible message and in the long run with even more debt that is putting us on a long term downward trajectory.","Institution of Higher Education",,,,,,

I believe I understand the stipulations of the student debt relief plan, but what I don't understand is how former students who still have student loan debt, like me, are falling through the cracks. 

I was in an undergraduate program from 2000-2002. Being a single mother of 2 and receiving NO child support, I was sustaining my family with my student loans, Pell grants, and credit cards. I graduated in 2002 and started my loan payback within that year. In 2010, still a single mother, I went back to school to get a graduate degree. This required more loans. After graduation, I had a pile of loans, both from undergrad and grad. In my desperation to make ends meet, I did a student loan consolidation with Mohela... not knowing or understanding or caring whether they were a private lender or Federal. I just needed a lower payment. At this point, I am STILL paying on this student loan after nearly 20 years since the 1st payback payment.

The complaint is that because Mohela is considered ""private"", my loans apparently do not qualify for any part of Biden's student debt relief. Why is that? My loans were federal at one point. I whole-heartedly believe there are thousands of people out there in the same predicament as me. I owe $8000 and to have this forgiven or paid off would be a Godsend.

Please add a stipulation for students like me to this relief program.","Student",,,,,,

This transfer penalizes those who saved and scrimped to pay for college and would be unfair to those who didn’t attend college and now bear the cost of others’ debt relief.

There have been concerns raised about the impact on senior citizens. If student loans are forgiven, it could strain social programs and services that rely on government funding. Redirecting resources from other essential areas to cover student debt forgiveness could affect seniors who depend on programs like Social Security and Medicare.

While student debt forgiveness would be a “great gift” to graduates, other types of debt (such as mortgages, car loans, and credit card debt) are not typically forgiven. Responsible adults are expected to pay for the things they purchase, including education. 

Responsible students that cannot afford a college debt, could always go to a trade school which typically take less than two years to complete and is less expensive. They then can get a well-paying job (most trades starting pay is $30+ and hour with benefits) in whatever trade they studied, and most companies have a tuition reimbursement programs in which the employees can take advantage in order to get their degree. This way also helps to fill the unemployment positions in these fields.

If the government is wanting to help someone, how about helping the millions of senior citizens on social security that are barley getting by as their social security checks are not keeping up with inflation. Social Security provides seniors with a cost of living and while this is good news for seniors, any real benefit of such an increase in Social Security benefits is offset by rising costs of medical care, energy costs, and other related expenses. More than 6.4 million seniors over the age of 65 live below the federal poverty level.

The government could also help by setting up funding for high schools to set up trade programs to allow students to learn various skills in order to help get jobs once they graduate. This is especially useful for the students of lower or middle class families who really has no way to go to a four-year college or university.

Why should I be responsible for paying for college for my own children, and then watch my tax dollars wipe away the college debt of others as well. 
Perhaps we need to recognize that we don't need everyone to go to college.  We need more people to learn a trade, and that does not necessarily require spending tens of thousands of dollars on a 4-year degree.  
My oldest child went to a technical school and finished his degree in 2 years without any debt. He's making good money right out of school while his friends are still in college (piling up debt) for degrees that they may never use. 
My youngest is currently enrolled in college and we are paying his way after working very hard to save money the best we could for his education.  He has a plan for what he wants to do and he will need a Masters Degree to do it.  We are OK with this since he has a plan for where he is headed.
Why don't we try giving better advise to high school students rather than continuing to encourage them to spend money on an education that may not be worth the money they borrow to get it.   I am 100% in favor of education, but only if it makes sense. I do not believe that the US Taxpayers should be responsible for picking up the tab for someone else's mistake when they spend more money on an education than they can afford to pay back.

Unless the proposed changes go into effect, I can foresee no way to get out from under the interest payments. I will end up paying all that I borrowed and a good amount of interest even with the proposed changes. I don't think that is cheating anybody. I do think it would be wrong for the government to do nothing about the insane compounded interest.  If the changes don't go through, once my loans are finally forgiven, I will be hit with a huge tax bill, which I will probably be paying until I die, and there is fair chance I would not be able to make those tax payments and could lose my home in my old age. Again, I want to stress that I am still slated to repay all that I borrowed and also pay a goodly amount of interest if the proposed law passes. I think the public should know that this is about acknowledging that the interest currently eing charged currently is and should not have been allowed. It is not about giving a free ride.

Here is the part that particularly affects me, below. But I approve of all of the changes suggested in the new proposal. 

Waiving accrued and capitalized interest for millions of borrowers
More than 25 million borrowers owe more than they originally borrowed, including many who have made years of payments, due to the interest that accrues on Federal student loans. President Biden will announce plans to cancel up to $20,000 of the amount a borrower’s balance has grown due to unpaid interest on their loans after entering repayment, regardless of their income.  
 
Low and middle-income borrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan or any other income-driven repayment (IDR) plan would be eligible for waiver of the entire amount their balance has grown since entering repayment. This group of borrowers includes single borrowers who earn $120,000 or less and married borrowers who file joint tax returns who earn $240,000 or less.  
 
No application will be needed for borrowers to receive this relief if the plan is finalized as proposed. We estimate that of the 25 million borrowers potentially helped by such a waiver, 23 million would see the entirety of their balance growth eliminated.

My daughter-in-law is paying off student loans but they make too much money to qualify for the forgiveness. 
 I guess they are being penalized for actually doing something with their education. 
 What about the business loans that I have from trying to grow my business and putting people to work.  It sure would be easier on my company if those loans got forgiven.  Isn't this interesting that the big push to get this through just happens to be during an election year.

Any debt forgiveness is illegal. It is also extremely unequitable. When measured by any fairness test, any student loan forgiveness is a travesty!!! Yes, many students took student loans to pay for all or part of college expenses, whether graduate or post-graduate. However, many paid for college by working and/or from funds saved by themselves, parents and grandparents for future college expenses. As a result, many students did not incur any student loan debt or incurred little student loan debt. It is simply unfair to repay debt for some while others who incurred those same expenses have no opportunity to receive such compensation. This even applies to individuals who have already repaid their student loan debt. Just because they no longer have student loan debt or never incurred student loan debt, they get nothing. Heck, if people had known student loan debt would be forgiven, those individuals who took out student loans would left it unpaid. Those who did not use student loan debt to fund their education would have taken out student loans and left it unpaid, waiting for it to be unforgiven. The effort to forgive student loan debt is the most unAmerican thing that has ever been pursued. Everyone knows when they take out a loan, it is their responsibility to repay the loan. In America if an individual is unable to pay a debt they can file for bankruptcy and request debt be forgiven. I understand student loan debt cannot be forgiven in bankruptcy, however that is a provision in a law passed by congress. If the Biden Administration wants to offer any sort of debt forgiveness it must present a bill to congress to change existing laws which would allow student loan debt to be forgiven in a bankruptcy. The Biden Administration cannot forgive student loan debt or any other debt, in an executive order. As I stated it is simply illegal. In fact, the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court, has ruled that it is illegal!!","Private/For-Profit Institution of Higher Education",,,,,,

Relieving anyone's debt does not infringe on anyone else's rights if they don't qualify, it simply makes a need to discuss their situation to see if they need help and direct them to what agency can help them best. At times, a lawyer is needed as many private loan borrowers don't understand the law, but since most people don't have law degrees/can't afford them, I digress.

During the Obama years, I tried to flourish and do what he said. I was 21 years old and a single parent to a 2-year-old. There was a new grant for single parents. Once I applied for financial assistance and to school, a financial advisor was assigned who said I had to go to school full time, work so many full time hours, plus be a parent (and prove all this.) My job fluctuated hours. Since I wouldn't have been able to see my child/afford so much daycare with another job, I couldn't take the grant. I didn't get child support, couldn't afford a lawyer for it, and lived in HUD income based housing. The Joplin tornado had just took out our last HUD apartment, but I was determined. My financial advisor talked me into taking the Pell grant plus the loans. I borrowed about 7-8k on those 2 loans altogether. It was the most money I had ever seen, and the advisor said I would need it for a laptop, books, and the things the grant didn't cover. 

I wanted to be a teacher, but the pay and system just didn't work for me. I'm an atheist with tattoos etc. in the Bible belt, and the 4 year probation sounded like a way to get booted from a school and waste a degree. I kept going thinking I'd just change my major, but was directionless. The advisors were predatory at best. Teachers were quote ""a dime a dozen."" They didn't have many other programs at this school, either.

Then, our Hud apartment caught fire and we lost everything again. I never re-enrolled in school. I had to work more. Afterwards, my tax returns went to my student loans. As a poor person with a dependent, I got back about 4-5k in taxes, and about 2 years at 4-5k went to the loans until Covid happened. My loans should have been repaid, but were not. They exceeded 10k, even after these payments.

My loan servicers don't count these as payments, however, and say I've never paid a principal amount. There's no record of these counting towards anything.

So, for those hurting in my position or other odd potions, this still may not reach them. I still do not find this to be a reason to not proceed. Please help those that you can. My loans ruined my life until Covid. I see covid as the only thing that got me out of a giant hole, which is sad. I make about 39k a year, and can't afford to repay anything more than some interest.

If everyone doesn't qualify for food stamps, you don't take away the food given to make it unavailable to everyone. People would starve. You expand later to include the outliers that may need help later. 

So again, please help those that could be starving. ","Financial Aid Administrator",,,,,,

For years during my training, my family lived on very limited income, but followed a budget to live within our means without burdening the taxpayers of this country. This is called personal responsibility and accountability! I feel this program will only encourage colleges and universities to charge more knowing that they will be repaid by the taxpayers. I think the department of education should hold the colleges and universities accountable for the outrageous tuition they are charging for students to attend their schools. I also think there should be discussions with the lenders about their interest and fees for these loans. When I was in training, there were programs that granted student loan relief for working for a certain period of time in an ""underserved"" area. Clearly, these borrowers need a class in how to prepare a household budget living ""lean"" until they are able to pay off their loans like the rest of the people in our country.

-Deter much needed recruitment for our military.  There is nothing more important than a strong military defending our country.  The #1 tool the military has at their disposal is a paid education for their recruits.  Let me ask, what is the incentive to join if they can get their education paid for through this program and bypass enlisting with the military?  

-Does this program continue in perpetuity?  I do not see how it can't.  We certainly can't select a group of let's call it, lottery ticket winners, to receive this forgiveness as a one-time event.  And if this program continues, how do we pay for it?  Our country is trillions of dollars in debt and our citizens just simply cannot bear any further taxing to cover the expense of this program.  

-I, like millions before me, took out student loans and paid on these loans for 20 years.  Having this debt gave me an education on how to handle debt.  I am afraid for what we are teaching our youth if we give them a free ride.  

-I watched U.S representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez make remarks that perhaps the money these borrowers will save could be used for things such as international travel, or for going back to school.  Let me ask a question that has a very obvious answer.  Is it right for the American taxpayer to pay for this program so the beneficiary can take a vacation?

However, I started at a junior college and then finished at a four year college, paying for my education 100% with jobs and a student loan. I worked while in college to support myself.  It never occurred to me that I should not pay my loan back and I did indeed pay it in full. I believe it is very unfair to people that have paid back their loans or for students/parents that saved to pay for theirs or their children's college education. People must be accountable for their choices, even 18 year olds.  If you are old enough to take out the loan, you are old enough to understand the commitment.  If you choose a college with a high price tag vs. a community college (even for a year or two) or a lower cost state school, that was your choice and you should be accountable for it.  If you choose a major that does not justify a salary that allows you to repay the loan, you made a wrong choice and you are accountable for it.  We all make poor financial choices at one time or another in our lives, and we are accountable.  You need to think and do research before you spend money on a college or a major or anything else.  Really, that is simple, straight forward, logical decision making. Why should my very hard-earned tax dollars pay for poor choices of others? You are not helping the homeless, less educated in any way, you are helping people with a college education.  I do not understand this.  When you take out a college education loan, you agree to pay the loan.  When is it NOT okay to pay back a loan?  Also, you are benefitting people that will, in time, make great money.  Why should they get a break?  We paid for our children's education, who will give me a break because I saved to provide an education for them (and by the way, went without things to save that money)?  Responsibility and accountability are key skills everyone must learn to succeed in life.  At a minimum, a ""release"" of student debt should come at some cost - have the ""college educated"" volunteer at high schools to explain choices for deciding on college in the first place and the responsibility of a student loan.  Also, potential high earners in the future should have financial responsibility for the future.  IF you provide relief for a loan now and if they make a certain amount years from now, they should pay it back.  I am sure many other options can be provided.   Handing out free money encourages having your hand out in the future.  You have no idea why people cannot pay their college loan - did they want a bigger house, did they want a nicer car, a country club membership, an active lifestyle, did they work hard in college or just get by, were they a dedicated employee, do they work well with others, can they keep a job, educated or not, etc.?  That's just it, you do not know and you want to give out this money.  It is like punishing the people that save and pay their loan, their education and their children's education.  The message is this - if you save and live according to your means and pay your own way, you lose! The ones that picked a wrong school/major and took out a loan, you win!  You know that people that needed the money had access, you know there are grants and scholarships out there and you know some people just went where they wanted to go with no regard to future earnings. Education is beyond a specific major, it is a life experience. How are you educating anyone by providing this?  The government should also be financially responsible and accountable.  The country needs so much more, the underprivileged need more, the homeless need more, the infrastructure needs more and instead you want to hand out free money for ""college educated"" people.  Our government officials should be for ALL people. Our national debt is absurd and adding this to it is shameful.","Other",,,,,,

This is yet another illegal attempt to ""relieve"" student loan repayment on a discriminatory basis. Instead of fixing the underlying issues associated with student loans, you are enabling universities and colleges nationwide to continue engaging in predatory financial actions against young people. It's disgraceful. 

Despite losing at the Supreme Court once already, you continue to flaunt the Constitution and subvert the assigned duty of Congress to spend taxpayer money. For too long, bureaucrats like yourself have treated the taxpayer like a piggy bank you can squeeze every last dime out of. You now seek to implement this proposed rule to provide political cover for your failure to solve this problem.

Prior to complete this degree, I also completed my undergraduate degree in business administration almost two years prior. I was working in a dead-end job in an extremely hostile work environment.  I decided to change my reality by going back to school.  I chose CTU because of the flexibility of online classes because I was working over sixty hours of week trying to make ends meet.  Though I have nothing bad to say about CTU, I graduated with almost $90,000 in student loan debt.  I want to be very clear that I did not take out any loans other than to cover tuition costs. Today, I live in Atlanta and work in the Banking industry. I make over $100,000 per year, which is considered a high income.  In retrospect, I regret attending CTU because the college did nothing to help me in my career - I did.  I obtained my job through personal networking.  Since I have graduated, I have not been able to leverage any connections from the university.  I also can honestly say that what I learned there has helped me in my career. Though my income level is higher than the national average, the cost of living is extremely expensive. I also have two young children under the ages of nine who both have special needs.  One is clinically diagnosed, and the other is pending a diagnosis.  The cost associated with supporting special needs children is more than I can afford.  I am writing because I hope consideration is given to families that may be perceived to make a higher income that are struggling to care and pay for children that have special needs.  These needs are extremely costly and many service providers are out of network and or do not take insurance. I accept my decision and fate of having to pay back almost $100,000 in loans. I am not asking for anyone to feel sorry for me, but I do believe consideration should be given to people in my position.  I also think it's criminal that the interest I am paying on my loans (6-7%) are higher than my mortgage (3.5%). I do also think CTU and other institutions should not charge excessively for tuition especially if they cannot validate, they placed a graduate with an employer. As a voter, this is a hot button topic for me.  I believe everyone should pay something.  Maybe a start would be to not charge interest if costs cannot be lowered.  Again, I also want to preface that I think families who have children with special needs should also either receive a higher tax credit regardless of income and/or some type of forgiveness or interest free payments.

I am in favor of the proposed regulation to relieve students of the overwhelming debt that continues to increase, just because we have tried to better our standing in society. A society that tells us we need to have a degree to even be considered for a job that will barely help us keep out heads above water. Most of the people that have to deal with this kind of debt make FAR less than the $120k that's being marked as the max earnings to be included in this proposal. Please help right the wrong that our country encouraged us to be victim to, and that educational institutions and lenders took full advantage of. Lives have been ruined, but this proposal could help provide a little bit of light.

I went to a Massachusetts state college which was largely paid for due to scholarships from my community and some grants or tuition waivers from college; my parents did not have money for college.  I was the first to go to college.  I had long term dreams to go to law school and I did in 2006;  I borrowed carefully and worked part-time.  Upon graduation, the  2009 recession hit and loans were increased.  I had to move back home and later joined the military.  My student loan repayment of 65k was taxed at 25% so lost nearly 20k of my repayment and had to claim the 40k, which went directly to student loans, as income.  In 2013, I went to purse a MLS to open up job opportunities as even with a JD and a MA bar license finding decent or any jobs in my field was difficult.  I also worked during that program.  My loans have accrued about 60k IN INTEREST on 200k; I have only been able to make small payments here and there.  Most of time had to defer due to hardship or be on income based plans.  Factor in life situations like both parents and sister passing along, along cost of living being so high the student loans become less important,  I will never be able to pay the interest never mind the principal.  

I was a first generation college student,  I borrowed carefully, I worked, I served my country, yet I am in an eternal prison of student loans.  If I apply for a mortgage I must be subjected to an exhausting examination due to the student loans; all because I chose to seek a higher education.  Many such as me must choose to save for retirement and own a home or not pay loans.  We cannot save for future and live today if paying for past twenty years. The lower to middle class is being penalized;  I was always told work hard and apply self yet being held down.  I am grateful for the loan programs but they are structured so that we can never see the light.  This country forgives corporations and billionaires through tax structures, why not offer some relief for the lower to middle class?Please offer any relief!!!!!","Other",,,,,,

People who complain that they paid off their loans 20 years ago so everyone should now are ignoring the combination of much higher college tuition/fees, higher interest rates, and higher costs of everything right now. This is a different situation. 

Relieving borrowers of these loans will cause a huge boost to the economy; these people will be able to use that money to raise their standard of living, buy cars, move out of their shared living arrangements, and finally get going on the life that previous generations took for granted.

I completed 22 years as a classroom teacher. Then retired.  I have always been involved with community activies.  
After I retired I began to work for the Childrens Advocacy Network which is a non profit.  My husband is currently a pastor and works at our local community college.  We both qualify for public service forgiveness after 10-20 years of payments on our Plus loans we took out for our son to attend Universial Technical College in Houston to become a Mechanic.

She has worked in the church as a youth pastor for the past 3 years and volunteered all through High School.  My son is a volunteer firefighter.  With all the volunteers service and the volunteer life that we lead, we are looking at $100000 in Plus Loan Debt to put our children through college while working in jobs that would qualify as years toward student loan forgiveness.

I began teaching in August of 2019, and my first year was interrupted with a global pandemic. Student loan repayments were paused for an extended period, which was much appreciated. However, I knew that it was only a matter of time before the $45,000 I owe would appear again. It has since gone up to nearly $60,000 with accrued interest. I suppose this is how much a four year education degree from a state university costs, but it was worth it for me to pursue since I am now doing what I love.

Millions of Americans and I are awaiting promises on student debt relief that would help us achieve what we want out of life: having houses, having families, having hobbies, and not having to worry about making a monthly payment that might be half a paycheck. I do appreciate the progress that has been made by the Biden Administration on this issue; however, in order to truly solve this issue, more people need more relief. I understand that there are a lot of obstacles in the way of this, and I am even willing to pay back a reasonable amount: but currently, I would be making a substantial monthly payment for the next 11 years, making it more of a fantasy to obtain a future with some of those things I want in it, and I'm sure I'm not the only who feels this way.

Any change in legislation as it pertains to student debt relief isn't a ""hand out"" as some people might view it. It is the single most important economic change that we can make to better our country's future. It is the single most important change we can make in order to create a more equitable education system for the students I am sending out of high school. This problem has been lying in front of us for decades, and the time to finally solve it is now. If we don't, we are doing a disservice to people who were only trying to better their lives and careers. We will also be perpetuating a systemic problem for generations to come.","Teacher",,,,,,

Upon completing grad school I was given two options: 1. Make a monthly payment I could not afford, or 2. Put the loans into forbearance. Even though I was an adjunct art professor and an art critic for my local weekly newspaper, I renewed the forbearance each year because I was still not making enough money to make the required payment. I contacted a representative from NYHESC many times and asked for a reasonable payment plan based on my income. Every time, I was told no such plan existed.
When the forbearances ran out and the loans went into default, NYHESC immediately went on the offensive in court and through debt collection agencies. They seized a couple federal tax returns when I was unemployed, so in reality they took my husband's money. (He did not co-sign on this loan and was in no way responsible for repaying it, by the way.) I sent NYHESC's collection agency Performant money to try to pay down the loan during the years 2016 and 2017, and to try to get them to stop harassing me and my family: constant phone calls, all day long, every day. It didn't work, they kept calling, and I still have no idea where that money went. 
Once I got a higher paying job delivering the mail, NYHESC sniffed that out and started to garnish my wages. It was a bit of a relief because the phone calls stopped, and they could only take a certain percentage of my income legally. It still hurt us financially though. Any unexpected costs or emergencies had to be put on credit.
If not for the pandemic, NYHESC would still be garnishing my wages. But I figured out a way, through the Department of Education, to ditch NYHESC for good. What a relief! Finally I'm making payments on my loans through the SAVE program, and since I deliver the mail, I'm working on PSLF. (I'm 57 years old, mind you, so here's hoping I stay healthy long enough to make all the qualifying payments.)
And here's the point to my story, one that I'm sure is echoed by countless borrowers here: If I had been given an option to pay on the loan based on my income from the moment I completed grad school, I would've been done with this whole mess by now! Instead, I got bullied, dragged to court, harassed and treated like a common criminal because I didn't make enough money to pay the amount NYHESC demanded I pay.

As a direct beneficiary of student loans, I can personally attest to their indispensable role in democratizing access to higher education, particularly during tumultuous economic periods.

Reflecting back on my graduation in 2010, amidst the throes of economic turmoil, student loans emerged as the lifeline that enabled me to pursue and ultimately achieve my educational aspirations. Despite navigating through the tempest of recession compounded by the recent global pandemic, I remained resolute and emerged with my degree—a testament to my unwavering dedication and unyielding resolve.

Yet, the looming shadow of student loan debt continues to cast a pall over my endeavors to forge ahead with my career and life ambitions. As a 39-year-old millennial, I've weathered the tempests of economic upheavals, from the reverberations of 9/11 to the seismic shocks of the Iraq War and the cataclysmic waves of the Great Recession. Now, as I endeavor to carve out my professional path and provide for my family, the weight of student loan obligations stands as a formidable barrier to progress.

The prospect of $20,000 in loan forgiveness is not merely a lifeline—it is a beacon of hope, a catalyst for transformation. It promises a reprieve from the shackles of debt and offers the freedom to invest in my future pursuits. Whether it's furthering my education, purchasing a home, or seeding a business, this forgiveness would furnish me with the resources to not only secure my own economic prosperity but also to uplift my community.

In earnest, I lend my unreserved support to President Biden and Vice President Harris's visionary student loan forgiveness plan, and I stand committed to championing its passage. I am prepared to lend my voice, my time, and my efforts to ensure the realization of this program, for I firmly believe in its capacity to alleviate financial burdens and sow the seeds of economic resurgence.

Thank you for considering my impassioned plea and for your earnest attention to this matter. With unwavering hope, I anticipate a brighter future, one made tangible through transformative policy initiatives like student loan forgiveness.

I have been watching the student loan forgiveness process closely for several years. Every round, my demographic has been excluded. I humbly request you consider individuals who are left out of your broadly sweeping plans. A summary of my situation:

Associates Degree in Nursing, 2003. (High cost of living area)

Bachelor's Degree in Nursing, 2009. I was working full-time with a young child and was recently divorced (spouse deployed 3 times to Iraq). I had to take out loans to pay my tuition and help with living expenses at the time.

Consolidated in 2009. Balance was about 40k. 

Had no intention of resuming college until Covid, when I was furloughed part-time. Began a Master's in Nursing Program in 2020. Graduating June 2024. 

I have worked continuously as a RN full-time for >20 years. Every time I went back to school, my servicer restarted my loan terms. Had I not gone back to school during Covid, my undergrad loans would be forgiven as they are now past 20 years (current balance around 33k). 

There are limited PSLF options for nurses in my community so that is not an option. Further, those positions typically pay far less and in a high cost of living area, they are not feasible. 

I humbly and respectfully request you consider forgiving undergraduate and graduate student loans separately. If a person has both graduate and undergraduate loans, why not forgive them separately with undergrad after 20 years and graduate after 25 years? Many graduate programs do not result in large increases in income (I get no extra pay for a MSN). Many teachers are in the same boat. Blanketly applying the 25 year rule to all graduate loan recipients assumes that degree resulted in financial benefit which it often does not. 

I now regret having resumed my education during Covid as I would now be receiving forgiveness for my undergrad loans that I have paid on for 21 years. My loan payments resume next month and after consolidating my graduate and undergraduate loans together, I will be paying for another 30 years (balance 99k). I will, therefore, be paying on a student loan for a total of 50 years by the time I've paid it off. All to be a registered nurse. 

I make too much for the SAVE plan to be feasible and too little to pay my loan off quicker while trying to support a child who will herself be starting college next year. My only affordable option is the extended standard payment resulting in a total of 50 years of payments.

At the very least, please make the 25 year forgiveness apply to all loan types, not just IDR. There are many people like me who are struggling in this economy and are still left out. 

Thank you for your consideration. ","Individual",,,,,,

This proposal to waive some or all of the interest for borrowers on an IDR plan is admirable. However, this proposal, without an opt out feature, may disadvantage some folks who are already on track for forgiveness under the PSLF program. Specifically, in some states, including my home state of Arkansas, PSLF forgiveness does not trigger state income tax liability. Other kinds of loan forgiveness do. I suspect that waiving interest under this proposed regulation would trigger state income tax liability. I personally would opt out of this waiver if I could. My most burdensome loans, from law school, are slated for forgiveness in less than two years under the PSLF program. I will not owe state income taxes on that forgiven amount. Arkansas specifically discusses this in its income tax instructions (attached PDF page 11, para. 15). See also, Arkansas Code Annotated § 26-51-404(b)(10) and its references to the IRC. However, if instead, the ED waives some or all of my interest under this new proposed regulation, I will owe a substantial sum in state income tax. My loans are significant given that I grew up poor enough to qualify for the free lunch program. I would never have gone to law school without the promise of the PSLF program. I would like to receive forgiveness exclusively under that program because it is the program I signed up for, whose parameters I knew and understood before incurring the debt I have, and under whose rules I've being making decisions for the past decade. An opt-out feature for the proposed waiver should not kick a borrower out of their IDR program, another potential disadvantage for those who prefer to stay the course set by PSLF. I.e. I should be able to opt-out of the waiver itself, without having to opt out of my IDR plan. It should be clear how to opt-out and documentation should be made of the opt-out election. This documentation should be kept by the loan servicer and the ED. Such documentation should also be sent to the borrower without the borrower having to request it.

I support these efforts to help Americans lift the massive debt burden that student loans have had on them for far too long. Myself, like many, were duped into economic hardship and forebearance by Sallie Mae and Navient, without having it explained to us what capitalization of interest means and what would happen as a repercussion. My initial graduation from college was 1999 and it was initially around $35,000. It is now $236,000 and growing everyday due to capitalization. I consolidated my loans in 1999 and was locked into 8.25% forever, even though I am now in the SAVE plan. How unfair it is that students cannot be on an IDR Plan and have lower interest. This locked in 8.25% has killed me. I declared bankruptcy at one point because I could not pay my bills. The judge rule that I still had to pay my massive credit card and student loan and again my loan was put into a deferment until I was able to pay all of my accrued credit card debt, I had accumulated throughout college while I put myself through college because I had no parental help. 

As an adult and now and understanding what capitalization of interest is I would have never made the choices I made. But with no parental help and predatory practices from the loan servicing companies as well as the credit card companies who came to my college campus in the '90s and solicited us and gave me a $30,000 credit limit, I stand before you as someone who has severe debt. Because of this debt I never had children nor do I own a home. This unbearable debt has severely impacted my life. I made the choice to go to college as a third-generation immigrant and was the first person in the family to receive a master's degree.

Lifting the burden of the capitalization of interest of those of us who were prayed upon by the loan companies would be ultimate forgiveness. ","Institution of Higher Education",,,,,,

I deeply appreciate the work that you and the Biden Administration are doing to help the millions of Americans facing massive amounts of student debt. As a current graduate student who has nearly completed five years of college education at a steep price, student debt relief is a very important topic for myself and my peers, and I want to communicate my support for this student debt relief program

Student debt reduces spending, inhibits business growth, and hurts markets and social programs. Reducing debt could therefore potentially spur economic growth — a desperate need as the United States is emerging from the pandemic economy. 

As of August 2023, Americans owe $1.77 trillion in student debt, according to LendingTree. That number will likely only continue to grow without intervention, given that the cost of college education is rising astronomically. The College Board estimates that a year of school at a private university in 1980 was just over $17,000, and under $8,000 at a public university. CNBC reported this month that the cost of one year of college is now nearling $100,000 at some private universities like NYU and Tufts. This exponential growth in costs will require more students to take out loans to afford a college education, worsening the debt crisis without some kind of relief. 

Students sign onto these loans when they are barely 18 years old, and may not understand what they are committing to or what these loans might mean for their future. All they know is that they need this money to get an education that is supposed to improve their lives. Some might argue that the social pressure put on young people to accept these loans for the sake of their future is almost coercive in nature. 

While I understand that some might argue against student debt relief because they were able to pay back their loans and because people made an economic commitment that they should adhere to, I counter-argue that loans today are much more than they were when many people paid them back before, given the increasing costs of tuition. Additionally, many borrowers’ have accrued enough interest on their debt that they owe much more than they owed upon taking out the loans in the first place. Lastly, the argument that some people paid their debts so everyone should have to is a bit odd when applied to other policy issues — if the cure to cancer is discovered, current cancer patients should get to use it, regardless of the people who passed away from cancer before the cure was discovered. It would be silly to not make lives better for future Americans just because past Americans were forced to suffer through their debt. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Ellie Prober

This policy change is not just a relief but a necessary acknowledgment of the sacrifices and contributions made by individuals like myself who have chosen paths that benefit society as a whole.

Having been the first in my family to attend and graduate from college, the financial burden of student loans was a significant challenge. Despite these challenges, I committed to a career in public service, driven by a desire to give back to my community and support the underprivileged. This decision, while fulfilling, has not been financially rewarding in the traditional sense. The proposed loan forgiveness recognizes the value of public service and the implicit social contract that if one dedicates their life to serving the public, there should be mechanisms to support them in return.

The specificity in the proposed regulations regarding situations in which loan forgiveness can be applied is particularly encouraging. It acknowledges that not all public service is the same and that long-term dedication in such roles should be rewarded and supported. This change would not only alleviate my personal financial stress but also inspire future generations to pursue careers in public service without the daunting shadow of insurmountable debt.

Thank you for considering this amendment. It represents a significant step forward in correcting the imbalance between the cost of education and the wages provided by careers in public service. Such policies will undoubtedly make public service a more viable and appealing option for many who wish to contribute positively to our society.

We do not think it was reasonable to anchor to such outlier amounts, and we therefore take the conservative approach of not including these dollar amounts. However, typical balances for Parent PLUS and Graduate PLUS loans are well below the amounts contemplated here.[15] Using a value of $138,500 is inclusive of over 95 percent of loan balances in repayment. Furthermore, Parent PLUS borrowers are only eligible for an IDR plan if the borrower has repaid those Parent PLUS loans through consolidation.”

 

Thank you for giving the public an opportunity to comment on the next avenue for student loan debt relief by President Biden’s office. I will be 62 this year and am single middle-class person who took out a PARENT PLUS loan to assist with the college education for my child. The first loan was taken out over 20 years ago. I have gradually increased my income but at the time the original loan was taken, I could not maintain any loan payments because my income and cost of living responsibilities would not allow for it and so I got various extensions and also consolidated the loans. Over the years, inflation and general cost of living expenses increased. I am just trying to find some relief, by eliminating or decreasing the interest amounts on these loans alone would make things much more manageable. Once the payments resumed, I obtained one more extension, and looked into ways to decrease the amount of the loan, the only one available to me was the Income Driven Repayment Plan, and that did not assist in any way, because it actually would have doubled the monthly payment amount which already is not affordable. I have a mortgage, association fees on a townhome, utilities, the costs of food and gas and any unexpected expenses (such as household repairs) which come with owing a home and throwing a monthly budget off track. I drive an automobile which is over 12 years old and will soon have to get another car. The current monthly loan repayment amount for the PARENT PLUS loan is in the neighborhood of $350.00. The majority of this loan is accrued interest. It appears that the PARENT PLUS borrowers are not being considered for debt relief and I am not sure why they are not factoring in as the debt for PARENT PLUS loans are often crippling as well.",,,,,,,

I gross about 44,000/year WITH a master's degree, as a second year teacher, granted, that's much better than minimum wage; teaching is also a 'not in it for the money' field, but at what point does 'not in it for the money' mean being unable to pay bills and just survive with basic needs, where we have to 'rob Peter to pay Paul'? I am grateful for the amount of pay I do get, and the benefits that come with the employment, but after taxes, insurance for my family, and mandatory retirement taken out because we aren't allowed to draw social security upon retirement, I'm left with an estimated $2450 per month to live on, plus or minus some change- this qualified me for the SAVE plan for my consolidated student loans and I do have a monthly lower payment because of that. BUT as a teacher, and knowing other teachers, we are not in a low-value educational program, but given how low salaries are in each state for teachers, the amount of loans some take out are disproportionate to the payments and interest they are required to pay back. While all first responders and pillars of the community are important, almost no one makes as little as teacher for salaries. I understand the risk this causes for raising inflation, and I do not like that it happens, but something has got to give with student loans and the way the student loan systems work. I can use as much forgiveness as possible. Although I don't particularly care for handouts, I don't consider helping people with student loans a handout if they're working and being a productive citizen and paying their taxes, or at the least, helping others around them if they can't physically work.

This has been proposed to “fix a broken system”.   However, this rule doesn’t fix the underlying problem at all, but without other reforms, exacerbates it, and it starts with a misdiagnosis of the problem.  The solution to runaway interest and ballooning balances is to lend less and limit the types of institutions that can participate in federal lending, not lend without limit then heavily subsidize the loans.

Through this regulation (30.81 in particular) it is clear how out of line the graduate limit is with median earnings, and/or the generosity of SAVE.  The fact that someone would have to earn $120,000 just to cover interest on the maximum of $138,500 tells us either that a) this cap is excessive for almost everyone who participates, b) SAVE is far too generous, or some combination of both.  $120,000 is over $60,000, or about double median earnings ($59,38 as of  Q4 2023).   Those borrowers rely almost entirely on the largesse of subsidies through IDR plans.  Rather than solving this problem, this simply covers it up with an accounting charade where you call a loan being “paid and current” even when the borrower isn’t even covering interest.

INDIRECT COST IS THE PROBLEM
The reason borrowing has gotten out of hand is not due to rising tuition and fees or the falling value of the Pell Grant. Although tuition and fees have risen, most borrowing is for non-institutional charges, i.e. indirect cost, and not only is this beyond an institution’s control but it is inappropriately included in the expanding universe of remote learning and graduate hybrid classes - which would have formally been considered electronic correspondence courses. Take care of this classification problem, and you will take care of a large part of the overborrowing and low value/poor return on investment problem.

THE PROPOSALS ARE OPEN-ENDED
The proposals are written so broadly that in when combined, they capture at least 2/3 of all borrowers and while it claims to be a one-time action, provides an open-ended authority to waive balances indefinitely for any of several reasons the secretary deems fit.

For example, under 30.83 new borrowers will reach the 20 or 25 year (240 or 300 “payment”) mark EACH MONTH.  This means every month new borrowers will reach the date of full cancellation, in perpetuity, whether they actually paid above $0 or not. Are we to believe that the Secretary will do this only once based on an arbitrary date?

Also, under 30.81 and 30.82 the MAJORITY of borrowers who took out an unsubsidized or PLUS loan at ANY POINT will have a balance that “exceeds the amount owed upon entering repayment”.  This was inevitable based on the generosity of IDR plans and use of deferments and forbearances.  Whether we like it or not, interest accrual has been a feature of student loans since their inception.  This is the tradeoff for not requiring immediate or full repayment.  

THIS IS HAVING YOUR CAKE AND EATING IT TOO
Under this proposal, which relies heavily on SAVE in particular, you can borrow as much as you want whether you can afford it or not and never worry about interest unless you hit the jackpot in your career.   No matter how much these subsidies cost, nobody is held accountable for this.
Under 30.82 or 30.86 through 30.88 no attempt is made to distinction between loan avoidance vs true hardship, between a consistent effort to fully repay vs making other life choices, blatant abuse (school hoppers or “grifters”) or straight up ignorance on borrowing. Borrowers who placed their loans into forbearance because they bought a house and a car and/or went on a vacation are now rewarded because they deprioritized their student loans.  

QUESTIONS THAT NEED AN ANSWER

Prior to implementation, there are some important questions the department needs to answer:

Under this proposal who does NOT qualify for a waiver of some sort? What percentage of the portfolio do they hold?

Going forward, who is expected to pay their loans in full and what percentage of the loan portfolio do such borrowers hold?

How do you plan to hold institutions with poor outcomes accountable?  We hear of examples here and there, but where’s the big crack down on the worst of the worst?  Removing TIV eligibility from a school for poor repayment outcomes is not “unfairly targeting” them, but the opposition only hears “for-profit” or “Christian” university and immediately labels it this way. You need to point out with specificity just how poor their repayment rates are.

Under 30.82, 30.83 and 30.86 through 30.88 how does the department plan to distinguish between those that tried but couldn’t make payments and those who simply made other life choices or deliberately avoided paying their loans? 

There was nobody speaking about program integrity, sustainability or containing the cost of the loan program at the Negotiated Rulemaking sessions, so these questions are a natural reaction to that fact.

I am a 57-year-old single female living in Seattle, WA and saddled in student debt (currently owe more than $165,000 with accumulated interest and much more than I ever borrowed). I made the choice to go back to college at age 27 to earn my bachelor's degree (married with two young children at the time) so that I could contribute to my family's income. Unfortunately, I had to take out student loans to help pay for this degree due to the high cost of college. I have been paying monthly student loans for decades (earned bachelor's degree in 1999). To further career to become a mental health therapist, it was necessary to obtain my master's degree which I proudly earned in 2015. Of course, this added to my debt. I am in a career that I love but this came at a very high financial cost. Even with a master's degree, my salary is low, and I do not live beyond my means. I am saddened and angry at the Supreme Court's decisions to shoot down President Biden's attempts to alleviate student debt. I have never expected my debt to be wiped out completely as I work hard and pay my bills on time every month. However, with the enormous amount of student debt and interest accumulating daily, I will never be able to pay it off in my lifetime, I am unable to retire at retirement age, and I have been struggling with high anxiety regarding finances for decades. I appreciate the opportunity to comment, and my hope is that someone finally listens to me and others' struggling with similar situations. ","Congress",,,,,,

To Whom It May Concern:

To completely absolve borrowers of their obligation to pay back their student loans is irresponsible.  The borrowers signed a contract and should be obliged to pay their loans.  

That debt doesnt just disappear.  Taxpayers are now going to pay for those student loans that were forgiven. Borrowers should have accountability, where is that accountability with the borrower?

I paid my $26,000 dollars in student loans.  I shouldnt have to be further punished for someone else's irresponsibility.

The promise of higher education as a reliable and rewarding investment has been tarnished for many, myself included, who placed our trust in a system that exploited our aspirations for a better life.

In 2009, me and my mom met at the art institute in Schaumburg Illinois. They convinced me 18 at the time that I should go to their school and they had an 80% job placement rate upon graduation. They assured me and my mother that my mom would be the CO signer and the loan would be mine. This was the parent plus loan. I went to this school and got my bachelor's degree in 3 years going through summers.
This school no longer exists. The entire building is gone. I can't even get transcripts if I wanted to. Often times during my years there they would interrupt me and other students and say we needed to go to financial aid and weren't allowed in class till we sorted something out. At least 5 times I went in and they would give me a check and tell me to deposit it into my bank. Then oddly several weeks later I would get another order to financial aid and they would tell me if have an over due bill for an amount similar to that check I just cashed.
When I signed up, they told me my highschool AP math credits would transfer and mean I didn't need to take those Gen Ed classes. Which costed over $3000 each. I was confused when they told me I needed to take algebra and geometry. 
They had ""school housing"" where you would share a 2 bedroom apartment with 4 people and pay the school $800 each per month. Thankfully I didn't take option. 
When I signed up they said I would leave with $75k in loans (25k per year). I left with over 90k. My payments were $1400 6 months after graduation and they were all in my mom's name. I didn't get a fulltime job in my field till about 4 years after graduating.
Today I owe about 230k. Admittedly, it's been very hard to make any dent at all when I was fortunate enough to try. I've lived with up to 6 roommates all from the same school until 2019. And with my parents several times as well.
I have no control over this loan as it's my mom's. Which is not good for her or her credit. I'm a messed up way though, that made it possible for us to get in income driven repayment and have a $0 payment for years.
However, this loan has changed hands with 4 companies and the fear that those payments resume is always there. My mother needs me to speak with the loan company but I can't without her, as she is the account holder. 
When COVID hit, interest was paused. This finally stopped that from growing. This gave me my idea. My loan's been at 230k from 3 years. But now it's back and $20,000 in interest is going to be applied to the principal finally. 
20k relief will help so many people, for me I have to Wait till 2034. It was 2029 but since I had to switch to SAVE that added 5 years. My mom likes to joke with me, ""at least when I die you won't have that loan anymore."" And I tell her,""Mom your life is worth so much more than that to me."" She knows, but we have no hope to ever pay this. 
Is it my fault, our fault? Yeah. But neither of us understood how bad it could get. That I would acrue those interest rates and have a monthly payment larger than my rent. Just before the government caught up and put those payment plans in place. 

I tell this story not because this will get me free from this debt, but because I I have a simple reasonable solution for this problem for kids and their mom's in the future. Of course I just want school to be free, it should be. But I know that's hard. So here's my pitch:

Student loans have a maximum amount of profit that can be earned for student loan companies or banks. What exactly? I don't know. My loan was for 75k originally and it's 300% that now. I think morally the profit made from different loans should be capped at 100%. That would make my loan 150k.

Still way too much, but a compromise. Again, I think it's immoral any profit is made of the back of the search for higher education. We should want the brightest and most passionate people to learn and better the world. To solve these incredible issues we have coming soon. If you need a stepping stone, just limit the maximum amount of debt a student can acrue. The banks can maximize something else.

I appreciate the chance to give a suggestion.

My impression is that decisions regarding outlay of federal money is the responsibility of Congress, not the Executive Branch. Also, I understand that the Supreme Court of the US voted against the first attempt by the current administration to forgive student debt. 

I understand the serious nature of loan repayment and the consequences, often unforeseen, that limit one's future financial decisions. Personally, I worked my way through college with limited money. I worked every weekend of my college career. My spouse had student loans as an undergraduate and during graduate school. We paid every thing we owed over ten years. He practiced in a health care setting and served in military for 23 years. We did not buy a house until our loans were paid. Two of our children did not attend college to avoid the expense. Another child had loans that were paid in full before she and her husband bought a house. We all had a choice about if we would go to college and ask for student loans. As with all other decisions in life, some things have to be deferred until there is money available to support the things we choose. 

More than a half trillion dollars to forgive student loan debt if these proposals are allowed? None of us will have a choice as taxpayers. Not us, our children, our grandchildren and future generations of Americans yet to be born. 

College is not a requirement. People who choose to go and sign a promissory note should be held accountable to pay the loan or negotiation personally to discharge the debt. ",,,,,,,

I am an individual with undergraduate and graduate loans. I thought getting a master’s degree would help ensure employment that would put me and my family in a position to begin saving for the future. Instead, what I’m left with is 6 figure loans, that have $40,000+ in interest. Finding a well paying job even with an advanced degree has been difficult. My most recent job paid $14/hr, despite my advanced degree. The crushing debt of student loans is stressful and feels like it will never go away, especially with the daily growing interest. I am participating in the PSLF program but 10 years with interest compiling at $15 a day, is daunting. I wish that the PSLF program had check points of forgiving loans in increments (25%, 50%, 75%,100% forgiveness), as one progresses towards the 10 year completion point, in order to combat some of the accruing interest. Overall, I approve of any and all efforts to help students get relief from student loan debt. Thank you for your efforts. ","Student",,,,,,

I was a single mom just trying to better my life for my kids and all I got was a debt I could never pay. It ruined my credit cause I couldn’t afford payments. It ruined my credit even on the IDR plan cause it continued to gain interest every day. I couldn’t get a car a home nothing. Never found a job for the career I studied so hard for. None of it mattered. All my hard work never paid off. And I went to college twice trying to better myself and both schools were a scam. By time I found out about borrower defense my loans had accrued about 40 grand. I made 7.25 an hour with 2 children. finally in 2022 I received approval letters but I’m am still waiting for my loans to be discharged from Everest and brown Mackie college. Every day has been a fight with servicers and constant calls to the DOE that wouldn’t do anything either. I have several complaints from last year on the website trying to get help from someone since I’m approved and supposed to be debt free. And I’m supposed to get a refund for all money paid but I have only received a small amount back. I ended up paying it to Ed financial because they said I still owed all that money so I didn’t know what else to do. I’m still waiting on my forgiveness. As well as many other people. I am still waiting for my full refund so maybe I can finally buy a house and pay off my car. To some people that sounds silly to a mother that doesn’t make much money it is everything. I hope this new plan will be better than the previous cause people like me deserve so much better. We deserve better colleges and a department of education system that cares about students and the money they borrow.  ","Other",,,,,,

Finally, it is projected by the IMF that our federal deficit will balloon to 8.8% over receipts by 2023. This is not tenable. It is also not fair to those that scrimped, saved, and sacrificed to fund their or their children's or their grandchildren's education.

Enough of the pandering. Tuition costs, due to easy financing, have far outpaced inflation. It is time for colleges and universities to use their tremendous endowments to address this calamity. Without reforms, more worthless degrees will be issued to those not worth the taxpayer's largesse.

The economy, especially now, has made it very difficult for anyone, especially young adults to get ahead & therefore, to make their student loan payment. Layoffs during COVID, the high cost of living in cities where opportunities are most prevalent and the cost of fuel for commuters are all reasons for my support. I have personally given a year of service in a US Government Corps program, to not only help tutor children, but to help my own family member who is struggling to chisel away at this daunting debt. I am thankful for a small Higher Education Award that I can gift to them. I am so proud of the fact that they received a degree, but college tuition costs are becoming a huge deterrent for kids, due to the costs. We assisted with the high cost of books and meal plans while our child attended college, but we could not afford to pay such high tuition, as a low to middle class HARD-WORKING family who owns a small business. This is just sad, that in this country, this is the case. Please push this through so that these young people can actually marry their loved ones, buy homes and start families, rather than worry about chiseling away slowly at their student loans. There needs to be better balance & colleges need to reign in their tuition costs!!! 
I am grateful for the opportunity to voice my opinion. Thank you.","Education Consultant",,,,,,

While I was in college, interest was being added to my loan balance, which resulted in a capitalized interest of around $5500. Any payments I made were first applied towards the accrued interest,  As per this draft I noticed - The original balance would be measured based upon the original amount disbursed for loans disbursed before January 1, 2005, and the balance of the loans on the day after the grace period for loans disbursed on or after January 1, 2005.  
it is kind of saying it applies only to accrued interest on or after January 1, 2005 which feels unfair because whatever payment we have paying going towards Accured interest not capitalized or principal balance.

In 2008 through early 2010, I took FFELP loans for my son which have ballooned to more than I borrowed because of capitalized interest. Right now, I am on an extended repayment plan to keep my payments manageable. This is what was recommended to me at the time when I spoke to Federal Student Aid, well needless to say this payment plan has gotten me nowhere with my principal amount, the interest charged just keeps me from paying down on my principal. I am in my 60's and feel like I am in a hole that I will never get out of. Over the years I have called Federal Student Aid for updated information on the types of repayment plans or relief that is available for FFELP Parent Plus loans to find out not much has changed. Are FFELP parent plus loans that are not consolidated or not on a save or income driven plan going to be included in the new relief plan. Would I qualify as one of the 25 million federal student borrowers that owe more than they originally borrowed, according to the Biden administration.
The school my son attended was a private for-profit media arts college between 2008-2010. The institution was merged before being closed in 2015, it was part of the Career Education Corporation which was involved in a Senate Hearing and listed in the Sweet V Cardona Settlement, the school had other complaints and allegations against them as well. My son did not graduate because I had him dismissed because the school mis-lead us at the time we enrolled him. This school had a history of mis-leading or omitting information. Would this fall under the Department separately proposing to authorize relief to commercial FFEL borrowers who are identified as eligible for closed school discharges but have not successfully applied. Would I qualify for forgiveness? I tried to complete a borrows defense application on my Federal Student Aid portal however there are problems with loading my documents and it will not process pass the point when it asks if you want to continue paying your loans. I was also told by Federal Student Aid it would take 3-10 years to find out if I would be accepted for forgiveness, that's a long time.
Thank you for taking the time to read my comments and questions. 
I am very interested in knowing do my comments and questions qualify for forgiveness under the new plan released or do Parent Plus loan parents need to do anything to be qualified. My 2 loans are not consolidated or in any type of income driven plan, I was not qualified for any of them. Only way I was able to reduce my payments was by taking the extended payment plan. How will this new relief plan help other parents with FFELP loans in a similar situation.

	It is not just or fair to make 87% of American adults who never went to college, have already paid off their loans, or worked through college to graduate with minimal to no debt--to pay for other persons debts.

I chose my dream job of criminal justice and the advisors said I would have really good job placement since there was two prisons and always needed police officers.

They kept saying they were accredited and any credits would transfer if I wish to further beyond what the school had to offer. I then looked at financial aid. My parents make too much and I didn't get a full ride. I took out loans with the school Willam D Ford loans through ACS or Direct Loan Servicing. I would make payments nothing would make a dent in the payments. The any money I had left over I would put back towards the loan and not expensive items. These colleges picked the loans and the high tuition rates and promises of jobs to help pay back the loans when in reality it was the opposite. I can't afford my payments. I never got a job in criminal justice because the curriculum has nothing to do with your line of work. No labs, no hands on. Just thousands of dollars in debt and broken promise to get you to that school. These loans need to be discharged as well. I still have consolidated loans with this school and a degree that I can't use. I should have went to ivy tech or Purdue at least employers will look at your resume and see the classes and stuff you did have. I filed a borrowers defense to repayment. Because the school has closed. It's a for profit college and I should not have to pay for a college that promises a job on my field and credits would transfer. They don't and no job was ever found. The curriculum was a joke as well. I hope my child goes to a trade school because at least they pay you and it's legit. I have been battling this since 2017 and I want my life back.

In 2004 I took out parent PLUS loan to pay for my son's college education and the amount of $17,000 for the year. Now in 2024 I owe $36,000. This is just for one year of his college education. During all of our loan counseling no one ever told us that it would be less expensive for him to go to college in his own state. Shortly after I went through a divorce and then a bankruptcy and my son's father refused to pay any of the parent plus loan, it was just in my name. So I deferred it for whatever reason I could defer it for as long as I could, having no understanding of how the interest would be added on which now totals almost $20,000. Now I'm retired, and working part time but because this is a parent plus loan I can't even get on the SAVE plan. Without debt relief I'm sure the remainder of this loan will die with me. Now part two - for the remainder of his four-year education I had to put 3 years of student loan debt in my son's name. However I never wanted him to pay for his college education, and 16 years later he still works in a call center. The original debt on this was about 35,000 for the three years and it ballooned up to 55,000 due to accrued interest from deferments. At one point I was able to get an equity loan on my house and I paid off the outstanding interest plus enough to get the loan down to $25,000 and now that he was able to get on the save plan it will stay at that amount until we are able to get loan forgiveness with the current rules from the department of education. And make these payments as well and greatly appreciate that they are much smaller now. I can't even get remarried because it will count my husband's income on The parent PLUS loan as well for the amount that I have to pay even though this would be a man my son has never even lived with and that he didn't even know when he was in college. My son can now get married but he has to file taxes separately from his wife in order for the payments not to double. What gets me is that two years ago the president announced $20,000 student debt relief he made it sound like a sure thing, he didn't say that this would be if it passed legal challenges. I was able to breathe a sigh of relief, but how long did that last?

There should be an additional option to forgive interest, so that people can pay directly on their principle. I have written the White House three times to ask them to look into the practices of loan institutions. Mohela will not allow additional money to go directly onto principle once the monthly interest charges have been met. Any additional principal money still goes towards interest. For example, if I pay the monthly standard payment of $265 and add $50 towards principle, portions of the $50 goes towards interest, even though I have met the interest payment for that month (the $50 is on the same payment withdrawn on the same day). It should be an option for those that do not qualify under the Save program (my payments would be up to $1600/month which I cannot afford), to pay directly on principle. This would drive down many of us who borrowed and pay but most of it goes towards interest.

Additionally, it is unfair for people who took out loans 20+ years ago and refinanced them into consolidated private loans, such as Nelnet, because that was the only option to decrease interest payments. SAVE wasn't an option and these loans should be forgiven with private institutions. 

Many of us do not mind paying our loans back, but the interest rates and previous options provided make it unfair when others are able to get their loans forgiven. Additionally, I'm a social worker but not in the public sector yet I work with adults with developmental disabilities and contracted through the State of Maryland, yet I can not be approved for PSLF (even though I complete work for Maryland).

There are a lot of considerations that should have been resolved, other than just doing a blanket loan forgiveness for a certain people. On paper, it may look like I can afford my loan payment, but SAVE does not take into account other expenses that families have.

I believe President Biden has a responsibility to forgive all loans, not cherry pick based on income/tax returns. This would enable many to purchase homes, save for the kids colleges, etc. and overall boost the economy.

I recently finished paying off my student loan debt this year, which was a total of $170,000.  In reading Biden's new proposed student loan foregiveness legislation, I don't see anything about retroactively refunding interest on loans that have been paid off.

When I took out my student loans, I knew what I was signing up for and made sure I did well in college so I could get a good job afterwards as needed to live and payoff MY student loans. It is not up to the rest of us (i.e. the Government) to pay for others to attend college without any responsibility for paying back money to which they agreed to borrow. Attending college is a personal choice and the taxpayer's money should not be used to reward people who can't find adequate employment to pay their loans back; maybe they chose a college curriculum that they would never find a job for to begin with... Again, that is a personal choice and should not become the burden of taxpayers. If you are going to carry out this foolish program, you should be reimbursing those of us who took out loans previously and paid them back with interest. That would be a good place to start!
 
While where at it, will the government be paying off mortgages for people who decide not to pay them off as well? What about credit cards or auto loans? Where and when does this nonsense end?
 
If you have enough extra tax revenue to pay off student loans (or offer student loan forgiveness), then you are collecting too much tax from the rest of us. Rather than pay off loans for people who agreed to pay them back in the first place, you should consider giving a tax refund to those of us who overpaid federal taxes for the past number of years.

Now my loan recently was transferred to Sloan Servicing and still no resolution. 

Right now I've been paying interest so my loan will not continue to swell. Nelnet put the loan in an Admin Forbearance due to the investigation of the forgery, but this has been over a year and I'm not confident anything will get resolved. I've talked to numerous managers, reps, etc., but nothing.

If I understand correctly, we would need to change the FFEL loan over to a direct federal loan in order to qualifying for forgiveness? I am worried to do this, as I have locked in some super low interest rates...can you guarantee that our interest rates will not go up? Will there be a guarantee that the loan will be forgiven before we go ahead with changing it over to a direct federal loan? Is there any way to grant the forgiveness in a separate or amended application process for FFEL borrowers so that we don't have to take the risk of changing it to a direct federal loan only to have congress squash the loan forgiveness again? It's super important that FFEL borrowers be included in this loan forgiveness as there were no direct federal loans that we could take out back then, this was the only option.

Joe Biden has provided no substantial reasoning or support for doing this and offered nothing to outline what this means for future borrowers of student loan funds. Asking the public to pay for something these individuals openly agreed to is ludicrous at best and blatantly unconstitutional.

Instead of trying to buy votes, why not come up with a plan to offer higher education at a reasonable cost going forward. Better yet, have some schools, such as Harvard, which, as of June 2022, had an endowment of $49 Billion, offer scholarships and direct financing to the individuals that meet their specific criteria.

Per the current loan forgiveness motion from the Biden Administration, I am concerned that this program is not fair to all Americans. With my wife and I both being educators, we worked very hard to earn our degrees and pay back loans. More specifically, for people like us who have repaid all of our student loans totaling thousands of dollars for a number of required degrees/certificates to teach in Connecticut, it is discouraging to hear that others will not need to do so. We could have certainly benefited financially from loan forgiveness programs, but it seems too late for us since we already completed our obligations for repayments. With that being said, how is it fair that others will benefit from loan forgiveness while hardworking Americans such as my wife and I will not?

I went back to school to improve my chances of getting a job in audio engineering. The Art Institute of Denver started a new program with state-of-the-art technology. I enrolled in 2013 at the age of 49. They very quickly handed out student loans at high interest rates which was the only way I could get into the programs. As you probably know, the Art Institutes, a for-profit college, went out of business in most parts of the country, including Colorado. I found a new college, online, with Berklee College of Music. Unfortunately, the accreditation of the Art Institutes did not match credit for credit in applying at Berklee, which resulted in taking longer to actually graduate, which I did in 2017. I graduated Suma Cum Laude, and number 81 in a class of almost 2000 students. I eagerly applied for jobs, sometimes on multiple occasions for the same job that kept getting reposted with no interview or job offers. I'm almost 60 years old now and it appears to me that ageism is rampant in the audio engineering industry. I did receive one job interview with Denver Open Media, but was not offered the job. I started with over $80k in student loans, most from the defunct Art Institute. I've been paying on these loans for almost 10 years and still owe over almost $50k. I'm approaching retirement age and am burdened by the inability to find gainful employment in my field of expertise. I'm currently on medicaid because I can not afford health insurance and make so little money. Without the relief of this package, I will never be able to pay off these student loans that have done nothing for improving my chances of getting gainful employment in my field. The Administration has taken impressive steps for resolving this issue for many and I encourage the adoption of this regulation. The biggest mistake was codifying student loans as a nondsichargeable debt in bankruptcy proceedings under the reform act of 2005. If anything, perhaps removing the student loan category from §523 of the bankruptcy code will help. Most of us don't have any assets and bankruptcy would be another option for discharging these debts. My biggest fear is that my Social Security benefits will be garnished to pay back these loans. I will be homeless and destitute if that should come to pass. Please adopt this regulation, even I may not qualify for the program. ","Financial Aid Administrator",,,,,,

The administration has done a horrific job of informing the public of the need for this relief for student debt.  These loans were predatory loans of the worst kind, that were targeted at the most unsophisticated and needy borrowers by the education institutions, the banks, and the government.  All of which should have been trusted sources and not scam artists.  
What loan do you not know the interest rate when you take out the loan?  And therefore, the payments.
What loan forces you to take more than you want because the school decides you need living expenses? They don’t do that with car loans because you must put gas in the car and maintain it. 
What loan can you not have discharged in bankruptcy court? Can you say Trump!
What loan is an absolute GUARANTEE due to the government’s ability to take money from tax returns or social security?  Who cares what college costs, we will get our money… guaranteed.
Some loans were granted relief during COVID, others were not (like mine).
My loan the was interest was capitalized because I had to take a deferment during the great recession of 2008 - 2012 – just when I was paying the most in interest.  I don’t think that is allowed anymore but I still must pay it.  I have paid more in interest than the original loan amount.  
I could go on.  For me, taking out a loan for an education, sadly, was and still is the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life. Well…other than not getting a really good paying job to pay for this lousy education.
Fix this awful system and help the people that were harmed by these predatory loans.

The ones of us who specialized in a field of study that would benefit us and the federal income tax system are being penalized for doing so.  I believe forgiveness should be given based on age, whether you finalized your education and made an income adjustment(that couples with additional tax adjustment), that are being used for the purposes of paying off the student loan debt, should be considered first.  Instead of the people who didn't make viable education decisions that would equate to a career that would allow them to produce an income that would not only provide them with a better life, but allow them to pay into the system of taxes that their pay-off for their education would be coming out of.  I have a BA student loan I have been paying on through Naviant for over 20 years and have barely made a dent in the amount I borrowed even though I make more money now than I did before my education and pay a lot more taxes due to this benefit of education.  I also have a Master's that I pay on that again gave me more funds to pay taxes with, have not gotten any benefit for relief on these items, but I am one of those individuals paying the extra taxes to pay off the student loans for those who did not make good decisions on their education.  Here is the kicker though, because of my age and the rate of payoff I am making, chances are I will not be on this earth to finish paying my education, so the tax payers will eventually pay it off anyways, it will be the first time I will ever receive anything for free from my government.  I wasn't privy to anything during Covid or any other time, I was a student who showed up everyday and graduated with honors and was even nominated as the whos who for my class.  I studied hard and even worked full-time, raised a family, and was a full-time student while I went to school.  I feel the only people who benefit from these forgiveness programs are the public employees and the people who took advantage of all the free programs to get money while going to school and not having to be responsible for their outcome.  These forgiveness programs have been unfair and should not be occurring, unless all student loans are forgiven.  Public employees should not have any better options than the private sector, especially since the largest amount of the taxes collected in this country come from the private sector not the public sector.","Institution of Higher Education",,,,,,

It also creates an expectation that the student might as well borrow the money because they will probably not have to pay it all back. 
Furthermore, colleges see this as a windfall and keep increasing college costs.

We unfortunately live in an American society that I would argue is in severe economic decline due to the astronomical national debt that continues to increase daily due to our out of control spending habits. The decision to forgive so many Billions of dollars in student debt places an additional large burden on the average taxpayer in the United States. I was raised in a household that taught me the value of being disciplined with my money--never spend more than you had, never borrow without being able to repay. It's a simple lesson that many even in your generation were taught from a very young age. Please do not place additional undue financial stressors on families who are increasingly struggling to make ends meet. Hold those financially accountable for the financial decisions they make, and do not ""pass the buck"" on to the hard-working Americans who have either 1) already satisfied their debt obligations in the past or 2) have chosen not to incur that debt and find a different way to improve their lives in different lines of work. I am a former military member who was entrusted with transporting members of your family/administration, and while I'm humbled to have served, I see the struggle amongst many hard-working Americans I live amongst in my post-military career who don't have the privilege of the ""security net"" that government pensions provide. I wouldn't have had the successful military career I had without incurring student debt to earn my degree (I joined the military after college). But, I worked hard, stayed the course and stayed true to my values of financial responsibility and paid off my student debt in full while serving on active duty. If I can do it, trust me, anybody who is responsible can also. It's a fact of life that to enjoy nice things, you need to work hard to get it. It's what sets America apart from other countries. Please don't follow through on policies like this that foster laziness and lack of responsibility in future generations. The prosperity and security of our nation depend on it.",,,,,,,

My husband and I have been paying on parent loans faithfully for 24 years and still have 14 years to go before they are paid off. Our loan repayment started in 2000, in 2005 we did a loan consolidation. After 19 years of payments on the consolidated loans we still owe over $42,000. I understand we borrowed the money and have no problem paying it back. However, our recent statement shows we have paid more in interest charges than has been applied to the principle. If the interest charges were less or better yet there was no interest on Federal school loans, we would stand a better change of repaying the loan. My husband was 48 years old when we started paying back the loans and will be 86(or dead) before they are paid off. We are not wealthy but wanted to give our children an opportunity for a good education. Borrowing through the school loan program was the only way to afford the tuition. That decision has impacted our future retirement.
 
Another issue is the loans are in my husbands' name, but the repayment amounts are based on both our incomes. I work in public service (with no pension); we would be eligible for public service loan forgiveness if the loans were in my name. However, even though my income goes to paying the loans, my public service does not count for loan forgiveness.

Please consider helping out parent loan borrowers whose income is only declining after decades of payments.

How are we not opening pandora's box and having other people demanding forgiveness of other loans that they willingly took on? This sets a very bad precedence.

I paid my debt, so why can't they. What do all the people who paid their college loans get? (To now pay for other people's loans?)

Why wouldn't we instead address the root cause of the problems that are leading to the high costs of college instead of putting a band-aid on the people that have already failed at making a good choice regarding that.

Why wouldn't we instead address the root cause of the lack of financial literacy in K-12 education that has led to these people taking on loans that they can't pay back or for education that they shouldn't have pursued.","Other",,,,,,

Eliminate student loan debt once and for all, do a one-time windfall payment to borrowers who already paid off their student loans, and make public universities and community college education free (federally funded), with private secondary education subsidized up to the average cost of nearby public universities. 

If we have the money to kill children in other countries, we have the money to make education accessible to everyone in our own. Investing in an educated populace is an investment in the future. 

These policies would be wildely popular among voters and completely turn our economy around.

To have the student loans of borrowers like myself to be partially or fully forgiven would firstly, take a large amount of financial stress off of the borrower and their families. 

It would also free up funds to go into the economy, instead of a few lenders, and servicers with predatory practices. We have literally bailed out banks and lenders on different occasions when the economy was bad, at the taxpayers' dime, and all that did was allow them to continue making insane profits at the expense of the population who keeps them in business. 

What's the difference here? Average Americans would get actual relief and be in better standing financially and also be able to put more money into their families' current and future well-being. 

I think it's time we stop focusing on corporate handouts, and start questioning them. I also think it's time we start investing in the average American's future and the infrastructure, programs, etc. that will help lift us all up individually instead of the few who aren't in need in the first place. 

I would love to stop hearing from my friends and family members that they are struggling financially due to ""inflation"" or suffocation by bills/debt. 

This would just be a start and hopefully a good foot forward for us to begin building a better future for our families, future generations, and the average American.

It shouldn't be a difficult situation to get behind. People complain about their tax dollars going to the average citizen when most of their taxes go to corporate welfare and the military. Please start focusing on us and the infrastructure of our country. The average citizen deserves to see benefits from the country that it carries on their backs.

While the proposed regulations outline the Secretary's discretionary authority to waive repayment obligations for certain categories of borrowers, it's imperative to ensure that this authority is appropriately constrained. 
Given the nature of federal employment and the importance of upholding public trust and accountability, it would be prudent to explicitly exclude federal employees, contractors, and employees in Congress or the judiciary from eligibility for such waivers.

Federal employees and contractors, along with members of Congress and the judiciary, hold positions of public responsibility and are expected to adhere to higher standards of conduct. Allowing them access to discretionary loan forgiveness could raise concerns about fairness, transparency, and potential conflicts of interest. Moreover, it could undermine the principles of accountability and ethical conduct that are essential for the effective functioning of government institutions.

By excluding these individuals from eligibility for loan forgiveness under the proposed regulations, we can uphold the integrity of the loan system and ensure that taxpayer funds are used responsibly. It would also demonstrate a commitment to fairness and equity in the administration of loan forgiveness programs, aligning with broader efforts to promote transparency and accountability in government operations.

I took out student loans when I was both in undergrad and in grad school. I knew full well what I was doing and that I had to pay the money back. I had scholarships, thankfully, but my parents could not afford to support me in any fashion, so I had to take out a few loans to help me survive. I paid them back. In full. So, now that I'm an employed adult, I will end up paying for the debts of others? Why? The  biggest problem with the world these days is lack of personal responsibility. Lack of personal responsibility caused the mortgage crisis. I see lack of personal responsibility of every day in my students who think late work should not have penalty, all exams should be open book and open note, and attendance is optional. 

The average student debt is less than $40K. That is less than the price of many new cars. If you buy a car and do not make the payments, it gets repossessed. If you buy a house you cannot afford, it goes back to the bank via foreclosure. Why should student loans get paid off when other forms of fiscal responsibility are not forgiven? People with student loan debt should make paying it off a priority, not just assume it will be forgiven and spend their money on other things that aren't always necessities. 

Nothing in this world is free. Nothing. And I am frustrated that future generations of responsible citizens will be paying off the debt for those who are irresponsible. And no, I'm not a millionaire. Not anywhere close. But I do make a decent income at my job that uses the degrees I went to school for. If someone chooses to go hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt attending a posh private university getting a degree in some obscure area of the humanities and then cannot find a job. That's their problem to deal with. Not mine, not other peoples. ","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,

This will only cause further inflation and increased tuition prices.  Government involvement will only make this worse.  

If any debt is forgiven or eased, we will have more money available for those people to spend, and this will artificially increase inflation due to the government's direct involvement.  

If the government steps in and pays off any tuition loans, the schools are rewarded for their increased prices and will only be encouraged to further increase prices in the future.  

The only way to help this for future generations is for the government to get out of the way and let the market and people decide.  Government backed loans are why we are in this situation to begin with.

I also ask that something be done about the high interest rates. I have loans that are almost 8%. I don't understand how I'm supposed to stay ahead of the interest and pay down the principals with such high interest rates. It is so disheartening to continually pay a loan and have the balance just keep increasing. I want to be able to pay down my loans but it feels impossible with the current set up. 

My payments impact my ability to save for future life events like owning a home, buying a car or starting a family. I don't want these loans over my head until I am in my 50s, I'm in my mid 30s now. 

It is a grossly irresponsible practice to allow young adults to take out loans for their education that are over 2% interest. The interest rate should only be an amount to cover the cost of the administering the program. This shouldn't be a for profit industry and it has become that with vendors. 

Please consider expanding this relief to paid interest. Whether it was automated or intentional to pay the interest - I thought I was doing the right thing by paying it. This program should apply to paid interest, as well! ","Other",,,,,,

It should not be the responsibility of anyone who is not a party to the loan agreement to be responsible for payments of another party.  

The individual party that signed the loan agreement received the education they paid for, whether or not they entered into their field of choice, and receive a salary for the job on their field of choice.  

The individual party had a choice prior to signing any loan agreement, obtaining/receiving any funds, to apply for various grants and scholarships, which could have covered at least a part of their educational costs.  

The individual party had a choice to get a degree in a field of their choosing, knowing what the potential income in that field is, and still chose to earn that degree.

I wanted to attend an accredited university and that caused a rift in my family because I am a woman from a heavily religious community who wanted a secular education. My parents refused to sign over my right to apply for FAFSA aid, which includes work study, and I had no other resources, had not been allowed to work until my senior year of highschool.

I enrolled at university with very little money, but discovered that unless I was willing to pursue ""abuse, abandonment, or neglect"" of my family, I was barred from access to things like workstudy. Destroying a family for my own sake, especially with other children, was not a real option. I would have swept floors and cleaned toilets to be allowed to apply for those grants and loan rates to study. I did eventually use FAFSA for a few semesters after I turned 23 and no longer needed parental sign off for it.

I desperately wanted the ""classic"" university experience and had always been in the top of my academic studies, had participated in clubs, societies, and extracurriculars that made me a solid candidate. I even tutored university students in a few subjects just to have access to the educational materials.

Unfortunately, between the rocky beginning and repeated life struggles with health, family, and simply trying to make ends meet, I had to indefinitely pause that effort to focus on surviving. At one point I was working full time for a major retailer making $600 a month take-home pay while trying to take a full course load. I simply could not afford to eat and pay basic bills, let alone fund a formal education.

Since leaving my family, I have lived in my car while holding down a full time and multiple part time jobs. I have worked for everything I own. I have survived cancer, have lost my partner at an unexpectedly young age, and supported friends through their own struggles. Today I am a home owner and am thankful for all I have, for every opportunity given to me despite my lack of formal education.

I value the updates to the educational system that allow young students to take college credit in highschool and boost their likelihood of overcoming similar challenges. I am devastated, however, at the proposed theft that would require me to pay other people's loans when I could not afford to put myself through college, and when until 23 I could not even take advantage of opportunities like work study that might have removed barriers for me. I did not have the money to proceed nor for five years the option to even apply for some opportunities that I would share in the burden of paying for under this proposed legislation.

I accepted the hand that I was dealt and made the most of it. Why, then, should I be expected to shoulder the imprudent decisions of others who did not have the means and made the decision to take on student financial debt anyway? It is a slap in the face to anyone who could not or opted not to pursue higher education. Do you intend to forgive my home loan as well? Where does the line exist that makes one of those a personal financial concern and one public? Is ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" only applicable to the university-educated, even at the expense of everyone else?

Reform the educational system rather than expending time and energy on this incredibly biased concept. Show educators they are valued by paying them living wages that reflect the weight their work has on our society during primary education. Remove barriers to higher education like the ones that held me back. Any U.S. citizen who is willing to work hard and earn an education should be allowed the opportunity based on their aptitude and their merits, not on their parents' or their own wealth. I believe the spirit of this proposed legislation on student loan debt forgiveness embodies a desire to accomplish exactly this, and applaud the goal. This is simply not the way. It puts a bandaid on a bigger problem for a few instead of addressing the root of the issue for future generations.

Thank you.","Congress",,,,,,

When are you going to pay attention to this group of people? These people who are having their loans forgiven are still able to work and possibly middle income to higher income adults. But you're not looking at the retired adults. Maybe this should be a group of adults you should be looking at.

In short, I've taught in the public school system for 39 yrs. My husband has been placed on disability due to going blind. Since I was the parent who signed for loans for our children, we don't qualify for medical discharge when our loans were given based on a two income household, but now we are both on social security and my retirement. It's sad that we don't qualify for medical discharge. I'm sure we are not the only retired parents in the same situation. Also, my children are being responsible and paying for their loans because they don't qualify for forgiveness, so they can't take over and pay my loans. Plus, the interest on the loans has doubled the amount of my loans.

Lay offs can prevent borrowers from staying on top of their student loan payments. Especially when they are focused on ensuring they are able to keep a roof over their family head, and ensuring there is food to eat.

If the PPP loads of borrowers can be forgiven, surely student loan debt can be forgiven.","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,

I am a student with about $50,000 in loans and this to me does not do enough. I attend and will be graduating from the university of Kentucky and I also spent 2 years getting my associates degree at Bluegrass community and technical college. I’m gonna first say that I got maybe 60% of my debt from the community college before the bigger university BUT if I’m being 100% honestly a lot my debt was used on basic needs like dorm food plans and then eventually rent living off campus because campus life was way to expensive. I worked 32 hours a week and did/do school full time and it was not enough to get by. Covid ruined my school experience a bit with the university closing early and I ended up taking some time off and when I finally got back the loan money I got was used to clear out debts I got like for credit cards being maxed out because kentuckys unemployment system was so bad I went 3 or 4 months not getting a penny after losing my job and the system was that backed up. My loan money went to clearing those debts and then eventually having to combat inflation. Where I’m at now is a lot worse than I was before Covid and my loans have prettt gone to helping me clear debts and surviving and paying for school. 

Now if I may just…. Focus on the bill. The head line says “student loan forgiveness” but the fine print feels more like a “interest forgiveness” plan than a loan forgiveness plan. You guys even removed the financial hardship part (which I feel like I and many other people would qualify for) so everything else feels vague. It isn’t clear what classify a college as a good or bad one. Specifically what is the measure criteria for if we are left in a worse position after attending a college. How can you guys determine that without having to do detailed reviews of graduation rates and experiences from students post college. I don’t think they can be realistically done and you guys have to consider one size doesn’t fit all and that vagueness in the writing of the bill to me sounds like it will limit how much will actually be done. So… The financial hardship should be re added.
Next the $20,000 amount while I think is a fair amount in the last bill some people qualified for only 10 while some others the $20,000. As much as I want people to get the most I feel like if the criteria is to broad it’s gonna get struck down by the republicans. I say that as a registered independent person. I feel like there needs to be a path open to people for full debt cancellation that isn’t a “if you’ve been doing blank for 25 years” or “if you’ve paid this for 10 years” cause it doesn’t do a lot for people in their early to late 20’s.  Can you imagine paying your student loans for 2 decades it’s insane. Another example of how rough around the edges this idea is, one of the suggested plans is to cancel interest if it grew to be more then what you borrowed…. That’s wildly different for everyone depending on the age but the youngest Gen z people won’t see that pay off. 

The amount of money it cost to go to school is simply too high and half of the money these college get are generated immorally. My tuition for UK last semester was about $5000 for 4
Classes. I’m now part time taking two and it’s still 5,000 while a full time student is paying $7,000. Where is the money even going. Because it’s not going to the faculty. It feels more like with my university and I’m sure most D1 colleges the money is going to administrative bloat. The education itself has not gotten any better. The teachers are not being paid anymore, but my campus always seems to be under construction in some way shape or form. 

The biggest issue I feel like is hurting us is our student loans are burden that prevents people from moving out of their homes starting businesses starting families and sometimes even engage in certain relationships. Inflation is way too high and a lot of people are having hard time living the loan situation. Is that bad. If you guys are thinking about, what’s the best way to stimulate the economy, I’d like to believe that that would be people actually spending money that isn’t on their student loans and people taking risk starting businesses that will stimulate the economy and that will not happen under this bill. I so desperately want a form of student loan cancellation but this particular idea isn’t and I say this is someone who would rather Biden being in office over Trump however, this specific bill in my opinion feels more like a bid to get the attention
of the younger generations and then not follow through because it isn’t exactly the best and if it even fell through, it wouldn’t be very good for everybody involved.",,,,,,,

For myself, as a first generation high school and college graduate from my family, I did not really have a handle on how being in default would result in wage garnishments and garnishments on income taxes. During the first few years out of college, I didn't make enough money to pay student loans as well as regular life expenses so I ended up in default. My original debt was roughly $14000. With income tax garnishments and wage garnishments for 5 years, I paid back roughly $10,000. Since they were garnishments, all of that money went to fees and never paid the principal of the loans. Today, after having paid about $12,500 on that $14,000 balance total, I still owe $ $12,786.14. In my case, the loan interest rates were capped, but all of the money paid didnt reduce the amount owed significantly. I don't know of any other loan type that would allow such egregious fees to be taken without reducing the balance of the loan like this. I think that it would be great if this bill could factor in all of the people, like me, who paid money to their loans via garnishments and had all of that money instead lost to fees for the servicer. That is a lot of money I paid and should be counted too. I have worked really hard to become a productive member of society and i just want to be treated fairly.","Other",,,,,,

This is a welcome start, but the cost of college is outrageous. Not only is tuition too high to begin with but the grace period for dropping courses with any form of refund is too short. 

Including my loan interest I have over $200,000 in student loan debt, not because I wanted to have that much nor that I thought it was prudent to carry so much, but because I was already halfway through my degree when I had an accident that caused me to need additional help. I frequently had to drop courses because I did not realize the workload would be too much. The schools offered little to no assistance, but they sure were willing to pocket the full tuition for those courses. They in effect delivered to me little to no value but received full compensation on what was astronomically high tuition in the first place. As they say, in for a penny in for a pound. My choices were to keep going or quit and either way I would have debt. 

This debt has now been an obstacle for home ownership and retirement savings. Even with the help of the SAVE plan it is a lot to ask someone to pay in addition to a mortgage. We currently can't afford to contribute to our 401K plans in a way that is prudent for our age. I was in school in my late 30s and this might be acceptable for teens and early 20s but this is unrealistic and unfair for adults just trying to start a new life. We deserve dignity and the ability to retire. Tuition should be cut drastically for new students and those carrying the debt from this predatory system should have it wiped clean, enough is enough.

I have some private loans that 2 weeks before covid when I was laid off and asked for help and they took the interest and rolled it into the principle in order to pause the payments, this caused those loans to now be higher than they were when I originally applied for them. They did not do anything about that once there was a general payment pause, my tough luck again! There is only so much of this we can stand! The lenders are predators, the colleges are predators and offer questionable value, and the government that should be doing its job and regulating this is just a willing participant in the scam!

If we can bail out the wealthy tax cheats, billion-dollar corporations and banks, we sure should be able to help struggling Americans that are just looking for a better life than the hellscape the aforementioned have created for us all. ","Private/Non-Profit Institution of Higher Education",,,,,,

 To the person that’s in charge of the student loan forgiveness program, I’ve along with many other Americans have been fighting to get loans forgiven. Unfortunately, due to the economic crisis I’ve been unable to fully pay off my entire student debt. If you take a look at my account, you will see that I’ve made payments in attempts to at least try to pay back when I have had the extra money. I will admit when going into college I didn’t understand that I would have to pay anything back, I thought that everything would be covered under a grant. There were a lot of misleading information given to me by Virginia College, which now the school has been closed due to misinformation. Going into college we were uneducated about student loans and debt and it is something that many Americans have fail victim to when entering into these institutions and colleges.

The price of college has risen dramatically while wages have stagnated. This proposal helps but it does not undo the harm of decades of bloated higher education budgets and predatory lending nor does it prevent those practices from continuing. In medical terms, you are treating a symptom without focusing on preventing it. A truly effective solution will need to do both.

-As written, this proposal does not require colleges to justify increases to tuition or operating costs. Without protections in place, college costs will continue to outpace wage growth. Audits, maximum tuition increases and other methods of oversight and accountability are necessary. 

-As written, this proposal does not reduce or eliminate predatory lending practices. Legislating a maximum interest rate and standardizing repayment periods so that borrowers aren't saddled with debt for their whole lives would be a good start. Basing the loan on the expected earnings of the degree after graduation would be better.  Education about ethical and unethical lending practices will be important in the long-term.

-This program does nothing to combat the misrepresentation of expected earnings and salaries online, and by recruiters sent to high schools. Why wouldn't someone choose to enter a bit of debt if they're expecting an $80,000 a year salary after they graduate? When stated like that, it sounds like a reasonable financial investment.

Right now, we have a system where young people enter contracts they do not understand and end up in debts that they can't possibly repay due to gross misrepresentations of their expected earnings after graduation. 

When I went to college in 2007, I signed up for the chemistry program. I agreed to tens of thousands of dollars in loans because I expected to be earning 60-70k a year after graduation. Google said so, and so did the career counselors and the college guides I read through before applying. I have never earned that kind of salary with my degree, even with 12+ years of experience in the field. 

If we don't legislate to prevent the entrapment of our young people by colleges, this system will never change and in a few decades, we will need to bail out our students all over again.","Four-Year Public Institution of Higher Education",,,,,,

Regarding PSLF and employment type: if an individual has made 120 qualifying payments by serving 10 or more years in public service but leaves public service to work at a for-profit entity, full forgiveness should still be granted.  The individual met the 120 payment requirement.  After 120 qualifying payments and 10+ years in public service, the forgiveness application should be honored, regardless of where they work at the time the forgiveness application is submitted.  To force a person to remain in public service during the application period is absurd.


2.) Rules should be modified for forgiveness based on loans and the program and school.  Example: Loan 1 in the amount of $4,500 was for a junior college.  The student gratuated with an AA or AS, then immediately transferred to university.  Student is now attending a different school and is in a different program, yet Loan 1 still shows as IA although it should be FB or DA.  

3.) In-grace periods should be considered for forgiveness if the student was working in public service during this time, especially if the student was a Pell grant recipient. 

4.) Regarding the forgiveness of interest:  My current student loan balance is $68k.  The original amount I borrowed was $56k.  On studentaid.gov, my loan shows as 15% paid off.  This details runaway interest.  Current balances should be adjusted not by the amount exceeding the original balance owed, by by the amount exceeding the original amount borrowed PLUS the combined payments made to date.  Likely, the combined payments made to date will have already satisfied the original amount borrowed.

I don’t feel it is taxpayer responsibility to pay the debt of students with no benefit to the taxpayer.  I paid my student debt, no one bailed me out.  My children paid their student debt.  No one bailed them out.  To unilaterally allow the secretary to saddle the American taxpayer with someone else’s child’s debt with no say in the matter is wrong.

In the section titled Summary of Select Provisions of This Regulatory Action, under Costs and Benefits, paragraph 2, the costs and benefits to the taxpayers are different than what is listed.  This summary attempts to gloss over the fact that taxpayers will now be on the hook to pay this debt which is quite large.  This section does not address the fact that taxpayers will be the ones that now shoulder this debt along with those former students.  As such, the secretary, nor the president, should not have the authority to unilaterally dismiss student debt unless the debt will be absorbed by the department of education’s budget funding and will not become part of a new taxpayer debt. To allow this, you will be in effect punishing taxpayers for another adult’s bad choices with absolutely no benefit to the taxpayer themselves. Each request to tax the taxpayers for another’s debt should be taken to congress for specific debt relief because this relief becomes taxpayer debt when forgiven.  It should be a vote of the people to erase broad categories of debt.

However, I agree, debt for post-secondary education is out of control.  The interest charged leads to the exorbitant amount of debt students incur.  Interest should be limited to a nominal 2% interest annually of the student’s outstanding principal.  This will ensure that student debt is manageable by the student and they won’t be charged interest on interest incurred.  Additionally, the debt should not become due until after the student graduates or leaves school, whichever comes first, and at that point, interest should start accruing, not before.  Reigning in interest charges will go a long way to keeping the debt to a manageable level.

Student debt principal should be repaid; it is a contract that a student made as an adult and students/adults should remain responsible for contracts they sign and agree too.  The student gains a service for a price and they have agreed that it is worth the cost by entering into the contract.  To do otherwise would be grossly unfair to the millions of students who did pay back their debt as promised.  Tax credits is a possibility for students to forgo paying some of their debt back but that also should be decided by the people through a vote.

In my case I have been paying for over a decade now. We grew up hearing daily from authority figures and parental figures that we HAD to get a college degree to do anything with our lives. The only way for thousands to get those degrees were through student loans. Banks would just give out loans no questions asked, and many students were going into fields that would soon be obsolete or would never be able to pay them enough in earnings to pay their loans off. Institutions kept raising tuition because they were getting those funds up front and with no obligation to the students receiving degrees from them to properly educate them on what their career prospects would look like. You can't reform the education cost in this country without also reforming the student loan crisis. Our student loan payments are preventing many students from either buying a house or starting a family. Our government wastes hundreds of millions of dollars every year on far less important issues than the student loan issue. It would also jumpstart the economy as well because many former students would now have hundreds of dollars now available to them every month. ","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,

Families are depending on the relief already proposed: over 26 million people have applied and 16 million have been approved.

I also urge the administration to enact this relief as quickly as possible to ensure millions of Americans can financially recover from the pandemic’s aftermath and have a healthier future.

I was defrauded by a school who promised a degree in sports law, high bar passage rates, high job retention, only to be met with a school with no sports law program, struggling academics, a lower curve than most schools, below average bar passage rates, and the inability to transfer to other schools because of the lower curve. It's a shame that so many students are defrauded, required to choose between eating, paying bills and rent or paying their student loan debt. These schools have double and triple dipped, gotten their money, and closed its doors, leaving us with worthless law degrees. A majority of my classmates do everything except practice law, we're play actors, boxers, entrepreneurs, real estate agents, travel agents, freight truck drivers, motivational speakers etc. Some of these options are by choice, while most is my force because we cannt find jobs in the legal field, because of our debunked school.

This amount should be increased to the next tax bracket limit for the year, which would be 383,900 for 2024.  240,000 is arbitrary and penalizes those who live in urban areas who earn more, but have a significantly higher cost of living. For instance, I am a professional and my work requires me to be in a city where housing, food, and the cost of living is extraordinarily expensive. In my profession, I could not make the same earnings in a suburban or rural environment. 

If the 240,000 limit remains, a married filing jointly couple should be able to achieve full forgiveness if they make a contribution to a retirement account equal to the difference. For instance, if the cap is 240,000 and their AGI was 242,000 and they pay 2,000 to a retirement account in the qualifying year, this should allow them to receive full forgiveness benefit.  This incentivizes retirement savings, which so many of us with crippling debt are lacking, and relief caused by the loan(s) with mounting interest. ","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,

I worked throughout my college years and paid my bills as required.  As a parent, I paid for my children’s college expenses.  It was not easy and we had to make many financial sacrifices to make ends meet.  I resent seeing the government getting involved in these bailouts when these students should be held responsible for the debts they willingly agreed to accept and, in most instances, are quite capable of paying back.  The Supreme Court has even ruled this is wrong and needs Congressional action if it is to be done.  Why is our government pursuing loopholes around the Court and thereby doing something illegal and clearly unconstitutional.  This is wrong and gives the impression that out government is not following the law. 
Please stop the bailouts and the abuse of out tax dollars!!  Promote personal responsibility and tell these students to honor their commitment and pay the money back as they agreed to do.  Thanks.",,,,,,,

I worked full time nearly the entire time and had to stop sometimes because rent was more important than school.

I was 42 years old. I borrowed about seven thousand dollars over a two-plus year time span. I got a job at a law enforcement agency and was told by my loan servicer (Sallie Mae, at the time) that after 10 years of working there, my loan would be forgiven-one of the reasons I chose law enforcement agency. After 10 years, I found they would not forgive the loan as promised and I owed more than I borrowed. I had a hard time meeting the payments after they raised the interest repeatedly and they kept encouraging me to take forbearances, so the interest piled up. Navient is now my loan servicer. I have applied for consolidation and relief, so I am hopeful. I have been paying for 30 years and owe more than what I borrowed although I have paid it down from 12 thousand-plus to under nine thousand. I am 73 (next month) and retired due to ill health and taking care of my parents until they died. I cannot make the $460 (approx) payments they say I will have to make. I still have a mortgage on my home (small) which I am trying to sell. My medical expenses grow yearly. I feel like I've been the victim of a scam. I know there are many students who are worse off than me. My loans were Federal Perkins loans, I believe, and I foolishly borrowed another $1,800 before I retired, hoping I could make enough to meet my obligations. Unfortunately, I found that the job (medical transcription) I was training for paid very poorly and was being phased out as doctors began using computers, so I quit the course. I'm hoping for any relief and believe that many younger students badly need relief as well. Any money we save will go back into the economy, so it will be good for America as well.

Please, at least, cancel school loan debt for first responders to include teachers. The pandemic caused many to leave the profession leaving us under paid snd under staffed. In our years during and post- pandemic we’ve been expected as teachers to reduce the gap in learning while also being asked to fill in the socio-emotional holes left from parental stress and/or neglect by default of the pandemic. The increased  “care duties” of teachers has been an unfair job expectation that likely led so many to flee the profession. Just because the profession is predominantly female does not mean a teacher has endless reserves of compassion or other skills beyond pedagogic. It’s been somewhat of an outrage as to what parents and/or admin have been expecting of teachers during and post-pandemic. We are not training counselors, social workers, nor nurses. I teach in the largest school district of VA just 19 miles from DC.

Over the years we had fallen on hard times and asked for deferment, which only allows the interest to grow. It took many, many years to pay down the interest and to be able to make progress toward paying down the principle. I don't understand why borrowers are made to pay these over exaggerated and exuberant costs for an education in this country. My generation was told that a college education was a path to a better future in being able to make a living and sustain an income that allows you raise a family and afford basic needs. Is it not greed that these student loan companies have been allowed to have 50, 60, 70-year-old still paying for an education that is essentially obsolete. Some adults are not able to retire due to the fear of not repaying student debt. As Americans we pay into this country with taxes with hopes and expectations that your government will aid you in being able get something in return for the many years of servitude and hard work. I am praying that President Biden's plan encompasses citizens like myself that aren't in disparity and but have had to borrow money to get an education. And still paying high cost for an education that should already have been paid for. With all the growing demands on the economy, rising costs of living and numerous other situations I'm sure Americans are enduring. Please grant us some relief. Please do not allow us to stay in debt due to paying student loans for a period longer than is needed and warranted. This country has seen some great initiatives come from our Federal Administration over the years. Let this be one as well.

The proposal to eliminate some or in specific cases all of this debt would make a significant difference in many American lives and contribute greatly to the economy. Please consider revising the way any forgiven balance is treated as income and subject to federal tax - this tax balloon is a cruel shock for many borrowers who struggle to get out of debt once interest has increased their balance. 

I want to share something I wrote this past August when my debt was forgiven under PSLF to show Biden's work in this regard has made a significant difference in some lives, and the trap some of us find ourselves in with student loan debt: 

After over 10 years of working in public service, my student loans have been forgiven under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) plan. 

I paid $22,425 towards a total loan balance of $50,996 between undergraduate and grad school, and by the end I still owed $53,943. I never defaulted or missed a monthly payment. I lived at home and went to community college on a tuition waiver scholarship for my first two years of undergrad. I lived at home when I went to graduate school. I worked part or full-time between different jobs throughout. 

Despite all this, I had to take out loans and my principal balance increased thanks to interest rates, amortization, and paying my monthly amounts based on an Income-Driven Repayment Plan (a requirement of the PSLF program). I paid these lower monthly payments with the understanding given the nature of my work as a public servant, my balance would be ultimately be forgiven. But I would have struggled to pay off my capitalized interest if I wasn't fortunate enough to apply for PSLF, and would definitely still be in debt today without it. 

I wish the student loan system would get a massive overhaul. Teenagers should not have to go into debt to go to college, and while there are TONS of valuable jobs that don't require a degree, realistically plenty of jobs still do require or favor people with degrees. No one should go without the occasional coffee or goodness forbid avocado toast because of student loans. No one should be struggling to obtain a degree because of their class or lack of generational wealth. We should invest in education because it strengthens our economy and society as a whole to have a diverse workforce. We should not continue to rely on a system that extracts as much money as possible from students who are often considered too young to rent a car but old enough to take out thousands of dollars in loans. And likewise, now that I'm free from my loan debt, I can invest more in my local economy and future .","Individual",,,,,,

First, as I understand it, this proposes to eliminate up to $20,000 (interest) for all borrowers with no income level stipulation.  Parties opposed to any debt cancellation will jump all over this.  It gives credence to their argument that Biden is trying to help the well off.  This sounds too much like the original plan to eliminate up to $20,000 that the Supreme Court struck down.   This fact puts the entire proposal in greatly increased risk of being challenged and again being deemed illegal by the Supreme Court.  If I remember correctly, the proposal for $20,000 forgiveness that was struck down by the Supreme Court had income limits, whereas this proposal does not.  To propose this with no income limit is illogical considering the first proposal for $ 20,000 forgiveness had income limits and this one does not.  This would be handing opponents or loan forgiveness a win.  This single proposal makes the whole thing extremely more easy for parties to oppose and win in court, including the Supreme Court.  

Second, this part of the proposal is unnecessary and unfair.  If borrower's are earning above the income limits in § 30.81, then it is self evident that they can afford to repay their loans.  Borrower's above income limits in § 30.81 should not have balances above original loan amounts, if they have been paying their loans back, whether under standard repayment or IDR.  This would only benefit people who are both a. high income earners, and b. delinquent on their loans.  This people should not be rewarded and helping them should not put the whole plan in jeopardy.  Their award was the high income they now benefit from.  ","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,

Pell Grants which once covered nearly 80 percent of the cost of a four-year public college degree for students from low and middle income families now may only cover a third of those costs, this was already true in 2000. The pay gap between the cost of living and the first year out of college salaries has only grown in the decades between 1980 to today. For many first-generation low-income students, education loan debt is a necessary evil to enter the workforce. A third of borrowers do not earn a credential, largely because the cost of continuing is a greater burden. An inability to pay is not a reflection of a single person, but a reflection of the economic system of which they are a part. Since 2000, there has been a recession, a global pandemic, and mass layoffs in the promised high-dollar-earning tech industry. Getting an education has never been a guarantee of wealth, but paying back compounded interest beyond what was owed is a guarantee of a life of poverty. This generation of borrowers, Ages 18-45 will be the first who are unable to buy homes, earn enough to save for retirement, and are already underfunded in entitlements such as social security. Therefore, I fully support the promulgated rule, already allowed by the enabling statute. I am satisfied that a committee consensus has captured all the nuances of the rules to make transparency of the execution of waiveable debt easy for all.","Student",,,,,,

The proposed language states the date is being used “because it was the day after the Department announced this rulemaking in a press release and there was no way a borrower could have known to consolidate and receive this benefit.” A June 30, 2023 press release is cited in footnote 27 to support this claim. However, there is absolutely no language in the press release that put would put any borrower on notice that he/she should consolidate loans to the get the benefit proposed under these rules. The press release makes no mention of consolidation or that the benefit being proposed in § 30.83 was under consideration. Not even the notice initiating the rulemaking process includes language that would put a borrower on notice of the benefit being proposed. It defies logic to see how any borrower could engage in “strategic consolidation” on or after July 1, 2023 up until these proposed rules were released on April 17, 2024. The more logical cutoff date is the day before the proposed rules were released.",,,,,,,

This will have a lifetime effect on the citizens of the United States. There are certain areas I would encourage further focus:

- partial forgiveness for disability: currently loan forgiveness for  is limited to full forgiveness with proof of severe disability struggles. But many disabled people still want to work and contribute to society- they just will not make as much money over their lifetime. I would recommend a partial forgiveness for certain working disabilites to prevent those people from being caught in all-or-nothing scenarios. Missing limbs, epilepsy, wheelchair users, autistics and adhd workers could be given partial forgiveness on a sliding scale, giving them a fighting chance to keep out of poverty and be able to support themselves. 

- Removing all accruing interest. Yes, for everyone. Interest that adds to your total debt makes higher education a poisonous endeavor. To move towards a free higher education and therefore a better educated workforce, we have to remove the loansharks from the waters. Citizens should only pay back what they borrowed. Student loans are a government program, not a country-wide scam, and its time we reflect that. 

- Free tuition for 2 years of community college or trade school for students with a highschool gpa of 3.0 or higher. This can be accomplished by a planned forgiveness of a certain averaged amount for those with the proper grades- a built in federal scholarship, if you will. Encouraging trade schools and associate degrees will help us add to our workforce quickly and easily, requiring less immigration from overseas. In twenty years, it could be normal again to have working wage from a trade, which would let you go on and complete your final two years of college debt-free. 

- Student loan forgiveness matching for 529 plans or retirement. The greatest concern over student loan forgiveness is the money being used immediately and causing inflation. Reward the public for not using those funds immediately. 

- Public Service Relief for part time workers. Substitutes and adjuncts are working just as hard, and may not have the benefits full-time workers get. They need relief too.

- Interest-free deferrals for stay at home parents for five years after their child's birth/adoption. We do not support childcare in this country - the least we can do us make things easier on new parents until their children join the public school system.

The proposal is for the Feds to borrow yet more money to pay off the debt of individuals who willingly took out these loans.

How about this idea-- how about the Feds first fund social security as it should be. That's the program in which workers/employers paid in trillions over the years to provide financial stability to people who make it to retirement age!

As someone who took out loans to get a degree in Education, but them married a military member and move every couple of years, I have not had the chance to establish any consistent work history. If I work in a location for the short time we are there, they are generally jobs that require no degree as they are the quickest to obtain, but pay is low, often not covering the cost of daycare. Perhaps consider loan forgiveness or atleast partial loan forgiveness for military spouses as well as being married to a member restricts our career opportunities dramatically. (Year long deployments, lack of childcare, frequent moves). In place of interest, it would be best if loan servicers charged a one time fee of 10% of the loans principal balance upon college graduation and that is the added to the principal balance and paid off, at whatever pace one can-IBR, standard repayment, etc. This would prevent the balance from growing during times of hardship, but the loans would eventually be repaid. Noone who took out a loan is opposed to repaying the loan. However, noone should have to repay 2-3X the amount they took out. Student loan service companies do not need to be making billion dollar profits annually off of students trying to just get a decent job. I was a single mom at 18, going to college and was the first in my family to do so. I worked part time during my full time college schedule and relied on student loans to help put a roof over our head and pay for daycare since online classes were just coming around at that time. I have been in repayment for 15 years and owe more now than I even took out due to not being able to get a consistent or decent paying job while my spouse has been serving in the military. In a couple of years, I will be able to go to work and not have to worry about access to daycare, by then I would owe 35-40K more than I took out in loans, despite making payments all these years. It's the interest that is the problem. Getting that fixed is key to helping the most amount of people and college graduates in the future. One time service fee instead of interest, problem solved.

These numbers do not include the student loan forgiveness proposed by this rule. It does not require a degree in economics to understand the current level of debt is unsustainable and adding to the debt load American taxpayers are already shouldering without any attempt to offset the cost of the forgiveness program will undoubtedly make a bad problem much worse. I am a firm believer that the men who wrote our Constitution were right to limit the reach and power of the federal government and the bloated bureaucratic behemoth that is the federal government in 2024 makes my point emphatically. Unfortunately, that genie has become far too comfortable outside of its bottle to allow for any real hope for the return of “government of the people, for the people, and by the people.” Nevertheless, the expansion of federal power demonstrated by the extent to which the Department of Education has had to go to attempt to create the proposed rule defies both logic and justification, particularly because the crafting of this proposal is specifically designed to go around a Supreme Court ruling against a previous attempt to eliminate student loan debt. The only way to make the proposed debt forgiveness even remotely palatable would be to offset the loan forgiveness by requiring debtors qualifying for the program to perform a comparable number of hours of community service. However, I doubt this idea would be feasible given the number of those eligible for forgiveness and the amount of red tape that would be necessary to monitor compliance. In summary, I strongly recommend this proposal not be adopted because: 1) it adds to an already unsustainable level of federal debt; 2) there is no plan to offset the costs of this program that would not punish those who have either already repaid their student loans or never took out any such loans; 3) the Supreme Court has already struck down a similar proposal; 4) the entire program is blatantly unconstitutional; and 5) it is my personal belief that this proposal is yet another short-sighted attempt by the current administration to essentially buy votes in what is shaping up to be a very hotly contested election.","Federal Agency",,,,,,

One person could be putting all this in the system to give false support for this gimmick. It's going to take the SCOTUS to stop this vote buying scam once again. Just hope they have time before the election to stop it. 
But a couple of points:
 * The SCOTUS already determined that the administration does not have the authority to forgive these loans. Just rebranding and trying again is an insult to the SCOTUS. They will strike it down again. Stop give folks false hope that their loan will be forgiven in order to get votes in November.
 * This administration / government is setting a bad example by not following the laws. Could be one reason we are having such a crime problem, if the government doesn't have to follow the law then why should I.
* These students well knew that they would have to pay back these loans. That's why it's called a loan. When I borrowed money, I had to pay it back. Was just reading this morning someone had $250000 loan forgiven for a degree in music. He made that choice, why should I pay for his mistake. That's fine it that's what he wanted to pursue. The US taxpayer should not be on the hook for his decisions.
* This administration has habit of not following the law. Just look at what's going on at the southern border. Enforcing what they want, ignoring the rest.
* Who's going to pay for this giveaway? Looks like just printing money, putting the country further in dept, devaluing the dollar. I'm on a fixed income, this inflation is hurting me and many others in the same position.
* Isn't it illegal to buy votes. Someone needs to be prosecuted and go to jail. 

 I really don't expect this to add to the comments collected. Dosen't fit the narrative.

We are TOTALLY OPPOSED to ANY student debt relief EXCEPT for those who will perform military service or civic service like Teach for America, Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, or a program that will pay back the debt with service to others and a commitment of time. 
 
Additionally, we would support student debt relief for students having completed a degree in the following categories that are vital to society, like healthcare (doctors, nurses) or science (any science field).  

We would also support student debt relief for children of military, law enforcement or first responders killed in the line of duty; for any retired military; and for any Native Americans.  

We particularly do not support relief for students who have had their debts for decades and have spent those loans on houses, cars, and in other ways that have nothing to do with educational expenses. 

It's apparent to us that this policy is being used by the Biden Administration to curry favor and buy votes, which is a expensive and despicable political ploy.  THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GET OUT OF THE STUDENT LOAN BUSINESS (AND THE MORTGAGE LOAN BUSINESS). They are in so much debt themselves, they should never be allowed to participate in debt servicing of any kind.  All of the student debt forgiveness you have offered will not help these people get better jobs or have a better future, because you are ruining their future with your horrible economic policies.  

As taxpayers, and the parents of children who worked hard to pay off their student loans, we resent this program. This is like allowing illegal immigrants to step in front of people who have applied legally to enter this country and have waited for years.  Another vote-buying scheme.  This is SHAMEFUL.

I have two things on which I would like to comment.   My son graduated from Tarleton University in Texas this past December and is in the Leander Police Academy.  He has saved his money for years and used almost all of it to pay off his federal loans just a couple of months ago.  He did not want to have to pay loans for 10 years or more so he paid a good chunk of them off, which I realize was his choice.  Because he was responsible, he is not eligible to get any of that money back.  If you are going to forgive loans, consider everyone even those that have recently paid theirs. His income isn't outstanding as I am sure you all are aware being that there is a Public service loan forgiveness program.  If there is something he can do of which I am unaware, please let me know.  

The 2nd thing is that he also has parent plus loans that are still active but, they are under my name so he is again ineligible.  We are talking about almost $60,000 total which is more than his yearly salary.  Clearly, those loans are for his education and unfortunately, his father and I cannot pay them all off for him, even though we plan to help when possible.  Those loans should be eligible for some kind of forgiveness when they are for the student.  Again, if there is anything for which he is eligible, please let me know.  I have tried to search but again, I find it all confusing.

Some taxpayers never had the opportunity to go to college because it was cost prohibitive, some went to a less desirable school that cost less because they couldn't afford the college they wanted to go to, without going into debt. Yet, as indicated in the below documentation, these same taxpayers will pay off the debt for individuals making as much as $240,000! With income like that, they should be able to prioritize or make the choice to pay off their debt and live within their means while doing so. The only student debt relief I support is for teachers. This should not be a federal issue, it should be a university issue. If public universities get any government funding, then they should be held accountable to make their school affordable to everyone. If the student decides to go to a private or more expensive school, then they should be held accountable to pay their debt.

Meanwhile, passing the debt to taxpayers, who are already struggling with affording gas, groceries, and housing, is adding to the burden of middle and lower class Americans, not helping. 

For perspective, I am a first generation college graduate. I spent years living within my means, including not going out to eat, not buying ""wants"" and staying focused on needs and paying off debt. As a single parent of two, currently attending college, students, I raised them to understand the importance of education, and as a reward for their hard work, both earned academic scholarships. Although helpful, it does not pay for everything so they had to make the choice of going to a school where they could still live at home but be able to work enough to pay the difference in college fees, or go to a more prestigious school but would incur debt and loans. Both decided going into deep debt for an undergrad degree didn't suit their long term goals (both want to go to medical school). They are already paying for student debt, to have them also pay for others, who make far more than the minimum wage salary they are living off of doesn't seem right. I ask for that to be considered when deciding if waiving debt for individuals who make more than six figures and passing it on to others who are barely above poverty is the right way in ""fixing"" this issue? 

Thank you for your consideration.

Add § 30.81 specifying the Secretary's authority to provide a one-time waiver of the amount by which the borrower's current loan has an outstanding principal balance exceeding the amount owed when the loan first entered repayment if they are enrolled in an IDR plan and their income is less than or equal to $120,000 if the borrower's filing status is single or married filing separately; $180,000 if the borrower's filing status is head of household; or $240,000 if their tax filing status is married filing jointly or qualifying surviving spouse.","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,

Congress has not authorized this relief and the Supreme Court's previous decision striking down the attempted use of the HEROS ACT makes it clear that it's unconstitutional for the President to unilaterally spend money not authorized by Congress.

PSLF was created in 2007 in response to concerns of public sectors employers attracting and retaining skilled professionals in public service careers. An advanced degree (masters degree or doctoral degree) is a condition of professional licensure for many public service professionals including but not limit to: mental health counselors, school counselors, psychologists, social workers, attorneys, and educators. Public service careers are in demand. For example, The Bureau of Labor and Statistics reports mental health counseling including substance use counseling is projected to increase 18% from 2022 to 2032 which is ""much faster than average"" (BLS, 2024). Public service professionals frequently incur a higher amount of debt to obtain the education and credentials required to work in the public sector. The amount of debt is often disproportionate to the salary earned for public service workers relative to the amount of debt incurred. The 10 year repayment period (120 payments) is too high for public service workers to receive the financial benefits for pursuing a public service career; this is especially concerning the higher interest rate on student loans including graduate loans. A 5 year repayment period (60 payments) may attract skilled professionals into these high demand but typically low-paying professions and limit the financial burden of student loan debt for these individuals. Also, PSLF should extend to parents who have incurred student loan debt on behalf of their children. Parent PLUS loans have been ignored in this discussion of debt relief. It is critical for the Department to recognize the demographic shifts in aging individuals in the United States. Americans ages 65 and older is projected to increase 47% by 2050 (PRB, 2024). Aging individuals are retiring, retired, or may be disabled which is a barrier for repayment on Parent PLUS loans. Reducing the PSLF period from 10 years to 5 years is equitable for all people who have dedicated their skills and talents to the public. I am advocating for this change in addition to the proposed rule.

Secretary Cardona:

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed effort to devise regulations governing the Secretary’s “compromise and settlement” authority in Section 432(a) of the Higher Education Act (HEA) and following the requirements of Section 492 pertaining to programs authorized under Title IV of the HEA.

As the rule is currently written—excluding regulations due to hardship entirely—it does not go nearly far enough. The rule, as proposed, would require the Department to process its entire portfolio to determine which borrowers qualified under the several provisions and take further administrative action, likely to tranches of borrowers spaced out over many months, similar to the current IDR adjustment, to provide eventual relief for borrowers who need and deserve immediate relief. The timeline of the still-ongoing IDR adjustment provides convincing and concerning evidence regarding the Department’s capacity to provide one-time relief across their entire student loan portfolio; namely that by the time they have completely released debts according to the proposed rule, some borrowers will face the “tax bomb” while borrowers lucky enough to be in among the first to receive their due relief before the end of 2025 will do so tax-free. 

In conclusion, I firmly believe that student debt cancellation should be swift, automatic, universal, and total. The Department’s previous efforts have fallen short because they were not. If the Department is determined to provide limited, capped, and one-time-only relief, that relief must, at minimum, be automatic and swiftly implemented prior to or simultaneously with its announcement. I urge the Department to move forward as quickly as possible with the proposed rule and implement an interim rule at the earliest juncture to provide as much relief as possible for as many borrowers as possible.

The only just future is one in which the government no longer punishes those who dare to strive by withholding the promise of full socio-economic participation unless the striver agrees to indenture themselves for years first. Until we achieve that future, the Department must act to ameliorate the many harms it and its servicers have caused and continue to cause for generations of students.

If the parent plus loans are consolidated into a Direct Loan, why are they not included in all the repayment plans and just ICR? This does not seem fair and is a burden to older parents who could not afford to pay for their child's education in full but rather took loans to help them.",,,,,,,

1) Canceled school loan debt, in most instances is considered ordinary income and taxed. The law to pause receiving a 1099-C for forgiven loans expires the end of 2025. After that people will start receiving 1099-C's again (except the programs exempt from that - public service, teach and VA only disability discharge - others with a disability discharge still have to pay taxes, etc.). Taxing (federal and some states) this money after that will be a tax bomb the poorer can not afford. If they are on medicare their B and D premiums go up. It is considered ordinary income for HUD (so they will have their rent go up or be given 30 days notice to get out if they are over the income limit to live in HUD - waiting lists are LONG!), SNAP (so they will lose food stamps), and TANF (will lose that),  but the affected people will not have one extra penny in their pocket. THIS NEEDS ADDRESSED. Taxing forgiven loans just creates a new debt, complete for many, with IRS payments, IRS monthly penalties, potential homelessness (HUD) or higher rent, potential higher medicare premiums they can't afford, and reducing or losing SNAP. 

2) Disability discharges (does not apply to VA disability discharges as they already don't get a 1099-C) - Many people who have received approval to enter the 3 year waiting period to have their student loans discharged will not have completed those 3 years by the end of 2025 (when the pause on 1099-C's for federal taxation ends- some states will tax it regardless). IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THEY WILL ALSO NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE PORTION OF THIS PROPOSED RULE TO DOWNWARDLY ADJUST THEIR OUSTANDING DEBT AMOUNT. This matters because of the tax, HUD, Medicare, SNAP, TANF, etc. issues. If their actual disability discharge will not take place until after 2025 then they need included in adjusting their balance (unless the pause becomes a permanent law. Since the IRS is free to ignore court cases, etc. this needs to be an actual law, just as the ""pandemic"" law was that included the pause to begin with) unless they are required to accept and honor Dept of Ed Rules. 

3) The students with low income/hardship discharges will have the same tax, HUD, SNAP, TANF, medicare issues as most of the people with disability discharges. They also will not be able to afford this. Perhaps there needs to be an income limit, tied to inflation, with a sliding scale concerning this if it is not possible to permanently extend, by law I presume, the pause. 

4) Included in the policy (and in a law to be safe from the IRS's broad directive that they can ignore court cases, etc.) should be that this is not considered income of any kind (so no state and federal taxes, no 1099-C's) nor be considered income for HUD, SNAP, TANF, Medicare or any other needs tested program (I believe Medicaid is exempt from this already). In other words make the pause permanent. If you do not do this people will just be trading one financial catastrophe for another; the new financial catastrophe has no hardship deference and instead has stiff and continuing penalties and interest even if you make your payments on the payment plan on time.

MY PERSONAL situation:
Feb 2024 I received approval of my disability discharge from Nelnet and entered the waiting period. In Feb 2027 (the pause ends 12/31/2025), presuming I comply, my student loans will be discharged. I will have discharged $99,000+ having paid back (all my school loans, not just these grad school loans which were $105,000+) a bit over $203,000 (plenty of capitalized interest with deferments - hardship and unemployment). Looking at the capitalized interest, if that were removed, I'd only owe about $3000 in principle. It would be far easier to pay taxes on that, pay the much lower higher rent (I wouldn't be kicked out), lose my SNAP, my medicare wouldn't go up... If you do not adjust those of us already in this situation but won't have them written off until the pause is over I will owe around $30,000 in federal and state taxes (I make far less than that a year with social security - I am 70). I will be homeless as I will be over the income to live in hud and it will take years to get back into senior hud, I will lose my SNAP, I will be unable to afford the hither medicare B and D premiums yet I have several cancers and so will have no health care nor be able to take my meds. I will owe interest on, and monthly payments on, my payment plan I would set up with the IRS (no idea how my state handles it other than they are one of the states that tax this money). This will be a death sentence for me. 

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE address these issues. Making the pause permanent, even if it is tied to income so that the law would more likely pass (unless you can make rules that don't need the rule of law to be honored by all departments and agencies).","Individual",,,,,,

My loans were originally consolidated under Navient in June of 2005 for the amount of $36,563.  After a few years of economic deferment I began making payments under the graduated payment plan.  I consolidated into federal direct loans in May of 2021 to help ensure my eligibility for forgiveness.  I then entered an IDR, however the monthly payments were way too much for me to afford so I reverted back to a graduated repayment plan.  After 19 years I still owe 22,995.

Because I qualified for a Pell Grant under the previous proposal I would have qualified for $20,000 in relief but fear that due to my consolidation resetting the amount of time I have been making payments and being unable to afford an IDR I will be left out of this round of relief.  This means there is a high probability I will still be paying off my loans when I begin to take on my children's loans once they begin college in 5 years.","Other",,,,,,

When the initial proposal for debt relief came out in 2022, it capped it to the 2020 tax year - but I would argue that wasn't a comprehensive view of how to account for student loan relief. Many borrowers, including myself, were on IDR plans making payments that would barely cover the interest. I see that there is a consideration for a full waiver on loans concerning borrowers on IDR - but majority of the payments made were prior to the loan freeze during the pandemic. However, measurement for the waiver is contemporaneous income - I would be considered ineligible despite the more critical temporally related timelines of loan repayment and hardships faced years ago.

It would be much easier to pay as I can, in the amount that I'm able, rather than having a payment calculated that is almost as much as a car payment that I cannot afford. Or even the option to be locked into a payment that is affordable, like $100 a month. I went back to school to hopefully find a better paying job, but we live in one of the Appalachia states where pay rates are barely at the cost of living.

Student debt is a growing crisis, and young generations have had to bear the burden of that growing crisis. This proposed rule can be thought of as an investment into future generations and their education. 

In more recent years, we have seen the fragility of the education and healthcare systems throughout the United States. Doctors, lawyers, engineers, and educators are some of the most important professions within this country and all require some type of post-secondary education. Medical students graduating from a public university typically acquire nearly $200,000 of debt. It is so, incredibly, discouraging for aspiring physicians, engineers, etc. to see this as their future. It is easy to shrug this off, blaming someone for their choice of profession, yet it does nothing to help. With some type of forgiveness, younger generations can meaningfully contribute to the economy in other ways. We cannot turn our back on professions who better society as a whole, as they drown in student debt. 

As a student myself, I am preparing to graduate in less than a year. While I am fortunate enough to be closing in on a master's degree with under $20,000 in debt, I cannot begin to express the dread I feel about the economy as a whole. Add a hefty amount of student debt on top of the growing economic burden that young people face, it is hard to even imagine buying a house. Young people are not being given opportunities at the same price older generations were. 

While I do support this rule, it is not lost on me that this money will have to come from somewhere. By eliminating student debt on such a wide scale, taxpayers will inevitably be footing the bill. As a taxpayer myself, I view this as an investment. Proposing tax cuts for private corporations that offer student loan repayment options through their company may be an interesting incentive. While this proposed rule will come with fallout in either decision, I believe that this is a crucial step towards hope in future generations being able to thrive economically.

I now have two postsecondary degrees and am making more than both of my parents ever did.

I keep a tight budget and am frugal with my money, 76% of my monthly income goes to essential spending while 12% goes to my debt pay off, leaving about 12% for savings and anything else. My current financial situation is not unique, and prevents me from owning a home, having children, contributing to the economy, and affording the quality of life my parents and generations before me had. 

I desperately encourage the support of this student debt relief. I, and so many others, have done all of the right things and are somehow still struggling to make ends meet. This relief would help ease at least some of the economic hardship that young people are experiencing today.

Student loan debt has been on the rise for the last twenty years, it has ""more than doubled in the last two decades...the balance per borrower rose 39 percent from 2008 to 2022"" (cfr.org). The $1.6 trillion student loan debt has surpassed auto and credit card debt, the only debt higher than student loans is home mortgage debt (cfr.org). Forty-three million Americans have to deal with the burden of student loan debt and the financial burden of being economically unstable due to student loans. Students are forced to borrow more money from the government to cover the rising cost of college tuition and then are punished for getting an advanced degree with the burden of debt (Whitehouse.gov). Many professional careers in America require some type of advanced degree, which can prevent a person and their family from being impoverished. But, if a person owes enourmous amounts of student loan debt, they are unable to get a head in life. This burden of debt can cause many low-to-middle-income families to fall into financial hardship and the inability to pay loans back, purchase a home, and live a financially free life. In addition to financial hardship, student loan debt can impact a person mental health and life outcomes. According to ""The Economics of Administration Action on Student Debt,"" debt can lead to higher levels of stress and anxiety, and ""studies also show that holding student debt can be a barrier to positive life cycle outcomes such as entrepreneurship, and marriage"" (Whitehouse.gov). 

Furthermore, I support the proposed rule to change regulation to specify what types of debt the Secretary can waive. Student debt relief can have long-lasting positive impacts on families and the economy. People who can get relief are more likely to ""spend more in their communities and contribute to their local economies...these consumption effects represent incredibly meaningful impacts on individual borrowers' financial security and the economic wellbeing of their communities"" (Whitehouse.gov). Also, debt relief will help to increase college attendance and the competitiveness of the United States with other countries. Overall, the passage of the proposed rule to change jargon in the current regulation to specify the different types of circumstances the Secretary can waive student loan debt would be beneficial for many Americans by helping them become financially stable and will have lasting impacts on the local economy and communities.","Student",,,,,,

 The claim presented to waive repayment of loans provided by the department with the goal of decreasing federal loan debt seems to be a great idea. I believe that is a step in the right direction for our community in order to provide extra support to low/medium income families that live paycheck to paycheck and alleviate their struggles a little more by forgiving what they own. This has been an ongoing issue in our society for a long time. It's a vicious cycle hard for anyone to escape from. To begin with, the educational system expects too much money to be paid by students that are freshly out of high school along with parents that might not be as fortunate, all for a degree so that they are able to achieve great things in life. But with the high rates of low income young adults tend to change their plans in order to fit with their budget, that is if they are courageous to not just go towards the workforce without a degree. This starts to turn into a hamster wheel. They aren’t able to afford to have no college degree, therefore are not able to get the best jobs and at the end of the day are always running low and waiting till the next big gig in order to make enough for rent, kids, and etc. All because they couldn’t have access to education. 
This is an absurd, if not this outcome, then they are stuck paying loans that have higher interest rates and keep piling up until their last breath. That is no way to live a life. People shouldn’t be fighting this hard to support an education that should be accessible to everyone. This is a conversation that has finally reached the table and got people talking. Many articles along with one in the Department of Education has stated how “More than 25 million borrowers owe more than they originally borrowed, including many who have made years of payments, due to the interest that accrues on Federal student loans.”(US Department of Education, Biden-Harris Administration Releases First Set of Draft Rules to Provide Debt Relief to Millions of Borrowers, paragraph 2). If this is not alarming I don’t know what it is. So many hardworking people that were simply delta wrong hand are still fighting even if they want to turn their lives or their kids around through school. People seem to forget that this is a country for all, therefore social status or not everyone deserves to be here and to reach their goals. 
This will help many people in our community to see a light at the end of the tunnel. After All this issue wouldn’t have been brought up if not due to the major urgency everyone has to move past debts and money problems. YI along with the article in regulation.gov as well expresses how “This set of draft rules pushes the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic student debt cancellation total to $153 billion for nearly 4.3 million borrowers”(YI, paragraph30). Which for someone that only sees the now may consider a waste of money but in reality this is proof of what we are investing towards the next generation that will take over our government. Along with these factors the White House has also made a statement expressing how depending on your status you can actually be fully forgiven. It states that “Already 8 million borrowers are enrolled in SAVE, 4.5 million of those borrowers have a monthly payment of $0, and over 1 million additional borrowers have a monthly payment of less than $100” (The White House, President Joe Biden Announces $7.4 Billion in Student Debt Cancellation for 277,000 More Americans, Pursuing Every Path Available to Cancel Student Debt, Paragraph 2). This will be the first step to many changes in the country if passed. The overall result regardless of what it may be will express a lot about our society along with the many issues of it and what path people are leaning towards, evolution or destruction?

Because it is unclear whether the interest on unsubsidized loans is capitalized before or after repayment (or if they happen at the same time), it is unclear whether this statement includes all interest that has accumulated on the loans or only the interest that was accrued but not rolled into the principal balance. The text should read ""or the amount by which the current outstanding balance on a borrower's loan exceeds the balance originally borrowed."" Setting the balance back to the amount originally borrowed would tremendously help borrowers of unsubsidized loans, especially those whose programs provided low levels of value, making it difficult for borrowers to repay their loans in the first place and contributing to the problem of runaway interest. It would also help borrowers feel that their loans are more manageable, making them (myself included) more likely to make additional payments when possible in order to pay off their loans faster.","Other",,,,,,

I think that the federal government should forgive as many loans as possible to alleviate the unfair debt that has saddled so many Americans for decades. Like so many before and after me, I was a middle class kid from divorced parents who didn't have a lot of money. My parents were working class and wanted me to go to college but couldn't pay for it. Once I realized I could get loans, it wasn't difficult at all despite my complete ignorance of how the interest would work or how long it would take me to pay them back even if I had a decent-paying job, which I never did until I went back to school to become a nurse.
The student loan process was always geared toward promising a higher wage and elevated status and in return, despite becoming more educated and more valuable to the country and its institutions, middle class college students were basically living in worse conditions than their working class parents because their debt saddled them so badly.
This can be remedied by loan forgiveness and would change the lives of so many and in turn stimulate economic growth while encouraging more reform in the academic world. The working class holds this nation up with its hard work, perseverance and desire to lift up their families to a higher plane. We should reward those who are trying to make their own lives and their country better by becoming educated.

I attended undergrad at a private college from 2001-2003, took one year off, transferred and finished up my undergrad at a public university by 2005.  I studied 7 semesters and graduated with a 3.65 GPA.  I then took one year off before going to law school at a public out-of-state university from 2006-2009.  I needed to take out loans and rely on financial aid for the entirety of my education.  I had no parental or family support or savings.  I was the first person in my family to go to college and the first to go to law school.

When I started law school, because my school was ABA accredited, I was not permitted to work my first year and was limited to working 20 hours/week my second and third years.  The only way to survive was to take out student loans.  All in all, I took out approximately $179,000 in federal loans and $75,000 in private loans.  I have paid off my private loans.  The federal loans have been such a high amount that being on an income-based repayment plan for the entirety of my repayment means that I have never made a dent in the principal.  Everything goes to interest and then interest has continued to accrue.  My current outstanding balance is approximately $360,000.  I have paid on my loans for 15-20 years and my federal balance has doubled.

I came to terms with the fact that I would never get rid of these loans a long time ago. I did manage to get a new role last year that will qualify me for PSLF, which was a relief in and of itself, but that is still 25-30 years of paying loans and going nowhere.  I like that with the SAVE plan at least the balance isn't continuing to grow, but that mortgage-sized loan balance hanging over my head never decreases and it's just depressing.  Eliminating the $180,000 in interest would be huge for me.  

I'm 41 years old.  I have a house and a child.  I'm making it work somehow, but we delayed taking those big life steps for quite some time because of finances and my student loans.  We are currently debating on even trying for a second child because even with a $190,000 household income, we are living paycheck to paycheck some months and relying way too heavily on credit cards.  The government has bailed out banks and the auto industry - it's time to bail out those of us who were sold on the idea that you NEED to go to college and that will get you a great job that pays well, and have found that this is not the case (especially graduating law school into a recession in 2009).  It was a bait and switch and I sincerely hope that the government takes steps to make it right.","Student",,,,,,

Conversations with individuals across various political spectra (i.e., Republicans, Democrats, Independents, etc.) have revealed a common preference for reducing or eliminating interest rates (and high origination fees) on federal student loans over comprehensive debt forgiveness. Moreover, it is unreasonable for institutions with endowments larger than the GDPs of some developing countries to continue increasing tuition fees by 3-4% annually while their endowments grow through investments in the public and private markets while their private portfolios generate several basis points of alpha over public markets (with seemingly only a small portion of realized gains allocated to student financial aid). 

Consequently, the Department of Education should consider policies that lower or eliminate interest rates (and high origination fees) for all borrowers. This is particularly crucial as the current income thresholds for ‘struggling’ or ‘low-income’ individuals do not adequately consider those living in high-cost-of-living cities, who may face high taxes and additional personal or family burdens overlooked by existing policies. Ultimately, the consensus seems that Americans are willing to repay their original loan amounts; however, the prohibitively high interest rates and their compounding effects create an undue hardship for all borrowers, regardless of their financial background. It appears that those who can afford higher education without loans would not typically need them, suggesting that any student who takes out a loan is inherently at a disadvantage.

It is also important to note that current interest rates and the burden of federal student loan fees are outpacing inflation and average compensation growth in the U.S.; hence, another salient reason to narrow the focus to interest rates and origination fees versus sweeping debt forgiveness. Regarding broad debt forgiveness, what happens when the next generation of students enters higher education and requires loans? Will their debts be forgiven? If so, how much would that cost the taxpayer? This is not a sustainable model, whereas the proposed alternative does. ",,,,,,,

the full amount by which the current outstanding balance on a loan exceeds the amount owed when the loan entered repayment for loans being repaid on any Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plan if the borrower's income is at or below $120,000 if the borrower's filing status is single or married filing separately, $180,000 if a borrower files as head of household, or $240,000 if the borrower is married and files a joint Federal tax return or the borrower files as a qualifying surviving spouse (§ 30.81).

Up to $20,000 or the amount by which the current outstanding balance on a borrower's loan exceeds the balance owed upon entering repayment (§ 30.82).

Had the SAVE plan been in force when I began repayment, I would have benefited significantly. I have paid on time for 15 years (or been in approved forbearance or deferment), never in default, and yet my principal has never dropped below what I borrowed. This is a significant challenge for so many former students like me who borrowed intending to do the right thing and repay, but for whom circumstances led to the need to take advantage of income based repayment plans, and therefore the ensuing ballooning loan balances.

Kudos to the administration for these efforts to enact some real change for so many student borrowers. It is my hope that all portions of these proposed regulations are enacted.","Individual",,,,,,

The following are the reasons that I urge you to take action against forgiving student loan debt for borrowers:
1.	Debt forgiveness will instill and fortify the belief that there are no responsibilities to honor, respect, and fulfill contractual responsibilities, and encourage future reckless borrowing and the belief that anyone can take money and simply walk away.
2.	America was founded on the fact that all people are equal and are treated with the same fairness.  The policy of forgiving debt for those that took loan money and have not paid it back is discriminatory towards those that responsibly paid their debt and to those that chose another career path instead of taking on debt that they could not repay.
3.	The idea of debt forgiveness for select individuals and the timing of such action is tantamount to bribery for votes.  For example: from an article in Business Insider by Ayelet Sheffey Apr 21, 2024, 6:18 AM ET the letter being sent to student loan forgiveness recipients states, ""Congratulations! The Biden-Harris Administration has forgiven your federal student loan(s) listed below with Aidvantage in full.""  These letters are being mailed just before a presidential election.  If anything the letter should state: your student forgiveness amount is being transferred to the national debt and will be paid by current and future taxpayers.  As a side note, the individual awarded this student loan forgiveness (in the amount of $250,000.00) said this will now allow “him the freedom to pursue some of his long-term dreams, including taking a sabbatical to study with his meditation teacher in India”.  How is this going to help the USA and how is this equitable to others that are repaying their loans and American citizens in general?
4.	Student loan debt forgiveness will increase inflation and be counter to the Fed attempts to subdue inflation due to extra money that will be made available for over consumption of goods and services.
5.	Student loan debt forgiveness will add to the national debt.
6.	Any borrower who may only receive partial debt forgiveness will be incentivized to not repay any balance in anticipation of further debt forgiveness.
7.	Student loan forgiveness will create a cascading erosion of the responsibility for debt repayment for all forms of debt such as SBA loans, and other non-collateralized loans and even loans that are collateralized that exceed the amount originally borrowed (Subprime Mortgage Crisis).
8.	The student loan forgiveness will only be beneficial to the individual, harm society, and create division and further conflict with responsible citizens. 
9.	$120,000 or less as a single filer is a ridiculously large upper limit for loan forgiveness.  At this income a person should easily be able to service the debt.  I was making $25K per year and paid off $24K in student loans.
10.	The proposal states that “regardless of their income, borrowers would be eligible for up to $20,000 in cancellation on the portion of their debt that is unpaid interest”.  This will potentially allow millionaires to avoid paying debt. 
11.	The Supreme Court has already decided that this was an unconstitutional overreach and this work around proposal is simply a unconstitutional circumvention of that decision.
12.	There will be reluctance to pay back loans and litigation from groups such as small businesses that also were entrusted with loans (SBA, EIDL) and rightfully so, since debt forgiveness for these types of loans would be necessary to eliminate discrimination and this type of debt forgiveness would provide the most payback to the economy by providing additional capital for hiring and growth.  After all, it is the small business that is the backbone of our economy.
There are many more reasons to oppose forgiveness of student loan debt and continue to erode our faith in capitalism, democracy, fair and equal treatment, and responsibility.  I urge you to foster actions that will encourage all of our citizens to be responsible, promote hard work, and perseverance rather than debt relief handouts for the select few.

My husband is disabled. He was a machinist, but he had undiagnosed Celiac Disease which destroyed his skeletal system. There are days he can barely walk. He is on disability, but he is still working so that he can have his IDR because he does not qualify for TPD. The man is hoping he has cancer so that he can die. He is in so much pain. If you are on disability, your student loans should be forgiven, regardless of the frequency of renewal.
Further, I myself have 132K+ in student loan debt. I borrowed  23K for Penn State, $40K for IUP, and $16K for City U. I went to school to teach preschool, which requires you to have a 4 year degree in PA. The problem is that when I went to school a degree in Human Development was accepted, now it is not. I went back to get my masters in Community Education, Covid hit, now I can't find regular work. I worked with kids for years in day cares, at risk youth, none of it counts because even though I was working 28 hrs a week and delivering newspapers, I wasn't a real teacher or working for a non profit. I made between $8.50-9.75 an hour.
To make matters more complicated, when I was growing up, my mother was an addict. She went to jail the summer between 10-11th grade. I had to get two jobs to finish high school. I had no money for college, but I was told if I worked hard, which I did, I graduated with honors, I would be able to afford to pay the loans back. I graduated in 2004, Penn State told me to consolidate, so I had FFELP loans through Navient, which I did consolidate into a direct loan. 
I just, I'm overwhelmed. I have horrible anxiety, and I can't afford to pay on those loans. I am working retail, home/cyber schooling my two boys, who are both are autistic with ADHD, celiac, and a host of EpiPen necessary food allergies. We pulled them after they were beaten up at school and kids put food that they were allergic to into their desks because they were the ""weird kids,""I couldn't send them back there, My oldest was choked and forced into a fence to hand flap and cry.  On top of all of this, I live in/take care of my 86 year old grandmother who keeps having strokes. 
I am 41, and I need help. My husband is slowly dying. He can barely walk up the stairs some days, but he goes to work because he was convinced when he found out he was sick that he needed to go back to school so that he could work, and all he has is debt and pain. I'm taking care of 4 people, working retail with a masters,
 I'm so tired. I don't know what to do anymore. Canceling our student loans would be a G-dsend. If your spouse is disabled, if your kids are disabled, you aren't making enough to pay back loans, your loans should be forgiven. I went to school to give my family a better life, life decided it had a different plan. Should families like mine be penalized for their entire adult life for a choice they made in their teens?  Where does that leave families like mine? Trust me when I say, I am doing Public service by cyber schooling. If we had let them in brick and mortar, they would be nonfunctioning. My oldest is enrolled in college in high school so that he can be a mortician (and save himself $24k in student loan debt because he is completing his first year of school as a dual enrollment student which saves you a  ton of money.)
I believe education can make the world a better place, but the world... Life... It breaks people, our student loans are HURTING my family. It would be a burden lifted, My husband could quit his job and I could try to find something else, but as of right now, I am literally working the job I have because of its flexibility. When my oldest starts to scream because he is in pain, my grandmother pees all over herself and I have to go running, my husband blacks out because.... the doctors can't tell us why... I am glad  I can be there for them, but when a loaf of cheap GF bread costs $4+  and your husband can only eat six foods without going into anaphylaxis or pooping himself.. I can't even begin to explain how exhausted I am.  Please, help people like my husband, myself, and my children. We never even had a chance. I believe you can give us one now. You have our vote. Please. CANCEL IT ALL!!","Student",,,,,,

My name is Charles H. King, Jr. I am a citizen, registered voter, a voter, and taxpayer for 67 years. I am writing to oppose the administration’s third attempt at massive student loan “cancelation.” Debt is never truly cancelled or forgiven, only transferred.
This regulation is not legal. The Supreme Court already rejected the original debt transfer plan under the HEROES Act. In part, the decision reaffirmed Congress’ sole authority to take such drastic action.
As a taxpayer, I oppose the federal government’s unconstitutional plan to transfer the cost of others’ student loan debt onto me and every other American taxpayer while our wallets continue to be drained by inflation. Now is not the time to force me to pay for someone else's poor financial decisions.

I however have the following concerns/suggestions:

Comment on § 30.81 and § 30.82
These two sections state that the current balance owed that is more than the initial  loan amount when entering repayment will be adjusted to bring the balance owed back to the loan amount when student entered repayment. While this helps with capitalized interest it does not give credit for the payments that have been made on the loan.  For example, on my loan with a current balance I owe $40,574 as of 4/23/2024, (and I made some payments during the COVID deferment period) my disbursements totaling  $34,979 (5 disbursements) started 1/08/2011 and I entered repayment in 2013. I have paid $11,608 towards this loan.  So, if my balance is reset to the original amount (or amount when entering repayment, everything I have paid so far basically has been interest and I’m starting over.  While it’s good it is reduced, but how about reducing the principal for some part of the payments that have been made since 2013.  How about lowering the interest rate on the student loans so the payments can actually be reducing the principal balance some. 
Comment on § 30.83
I understand that only loans with an outstanding balance and entered prepayment prior to July 1, 2005, will be adjusted/forgiven.  My current loan with an outstanding balance is discussed in the paragraph above.  However, since starting my journey to obtain a college education I took out other loans and have repaid them.  In addition to the loan (disbursements) listed above I received six other disbursements/loans for a total of $35,107 with repayments starting on 11/11/2002.  I consolidated some of these loans in 2006. I don’t know how much I actually paid including interest on these loans but have repaid the entire balance.  I paid off the last balance on these loans in 2/2024. As a side note I also paid off a $6,300 parent loan.  So, I have been paying on student loans to get my undergraduate degree since 2002. I graduated in May 2013. I believe these (all) payments  should be considered when looking at potential forgiveness since I have been paying on my undergraduate student loans since 2002.

If I were to utilize an IDR repayment plan, I would pay back double what I owe after 20 years of payments AND I would consistently pay more income tax each year. This is predatory and prohibits individuals from being able to fully participate in the market economy.

Lastly, I would like to suggest that the PSLF would be a more efficient plan if a percentage of an individual's debt were to be waived for each year of service rather than requiring a certain amount of service to waive the entire balance.

My options are to either give up on my degree part-way through or be forced to borrow at interest rates I had no intention of ever borrowing at. In addition, the original forgiveness we were to receive was blocked and none of the follow-on forgiveness applies to us. If I had the option, I would happily return the student loans and drop out of school.

My reasons are:
1.  This debt forgiveness of $84 billion will contribute to current U.S. debt of over $141 trillion by 2054; a debt that is higher than recently projected.  
2. Loan forgiveness is not fair for those who will pay increased taxes to pay for this debt.  Many of which did not have the opportunity to attend college or did not go to college.  Many of these individuals also have debts such as mortgage, car payments, childcare costs, and rising utility and food expenses.
3.  The decision to attend selected colleges, major in studies that may not be above-average or high-earning careers, or elected to take out loans to finance their education was made by the individuals who are now responsible for repayment.  Individual decision making comes with the responsibility of Accountability for those decisions.  By forgiving student loans, we are contributing to a culture of entitlement and not being responsible for one's actions and decisions.
Neither of my parents could afford to go to college or even a trade school.  They instilled in me that furthering my education was very important.  So, I studied and got student and state college scholarships, worked to contribute to my tuition and room and board costs, and attended a lower cost state school.  I value my education and what it has provided me and I'm proud that I did it without help from other citizens.
Bottom line, by forgiving student loans, the Federal Government is sticking Americans with someone else's debt.  How can that be fair?",,,,,,,

The burden of student loan debt is a significant weight on millions of Americans. It hinders their ability to buy homes, start businesses, and contribute fully to the economy. These proposed measures offer a chance to alleviate some of that burden and promote financial well-being.

Specifically, I appreciate the focus on providing targeted debt relief. This ensures that the program benefits those who need it most. Additionally, the emphasis on the Secretary's discretion allows for flexibility in addressing unique situations.

I also think it is important to make the application process easy for borrowers to understand. This is a problem that I see personally as a student for many things, from scholarships to all types of aid.

I am a pell grant recipient and borrower who is experiencing the runaway interest issue and I strongly support eliminating the runaway interest.

So, in addition to the adjustment of runaway interest I am extremely  supportive of retroactively applying borrowers payments that went to runaway interest toward their principal balance as a part of this adjustment process.

I started my undergraduate degree in 2007, feeling confident that I would be able to take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. After graduating in 2011, the State of Illinois was in a financial crisis and was severely underfunding social services. I was unable to find a job in my field and ended up working at Walmart, then finding a job in marketing through a temp agency. I utilized the SNAP program to help me purchase groceries for a while. During this period, I used deferment and income-based repayment plans to manage my debt. It was three years before I decided to go back to school for my Masters of Social Work degree in 2014, hoping to become more financially secure. After grad school, I moved to California and worked for a non-profit serving low-income residents, ready to work towards my 7 years in order to qualify for loan forgiveness. The non-profit employers that you have to work for in order to be eligible for the PSLF program are notoriously underpaid, underfunded, understaffed and overworked. It began to take a toll on my physical and mental health, and I had to change jobs every year or two. Some of the available jobs were for-profit employers or as a contractor, which made my labor ineligible for the PSLF program. I am so burnt out by the mental health field that I am now pursuing other career options. I've lost hope of ever being eligible for the PSLF program. The PSLF program, in hindsight, felt like a trap. There have been so many barriers to compliance, and the state itself has contributed to poor working conditions by cutting social service budgets. 

It feel helpless. Every year my interest is capitalized, and my balance never decreases. I don't know what to do. Please help me and people like me.

Hello. My name is April Wright and I am from Barlow, Kentucky. I am a 43 year old woman who works full-time for a DOE government contractor. I have worked for various contractors at the same plant site since 2007. The plant that I work at in Paducah, KY used to enrich uranium. We ceased enrichment operations sometime in 2013 and now we are conducting deactivation and clean-up operations.

I received my bachelors degree in 2017. After I graduated high school in 1999, I attended college until 2005 when I decided to enter the work force full-time instead of completing the last year of school. But I returned to school in 2016, while working full-time, to finish what I started and as I said, received my degree in 2017 from Murray State University here in Kentucky.

I haven't taken out a student loan since around 2004/2005. Once I began repayment of my student loans I wasn't making a lot of money and the monthly payments were impossible for me to make on a consistent basis. But I made the payments that I could. Under President Obama's administration I was able to consolidate my federal student loans and was given a much lower and affordable repayment plan. My income situation steadily improved and because of the lower payment I made consistent loan payments until all student loan payments were placed on hold during COVID. I did not place the repayments on hold as they were automatically placed on hold. The only other times my repayments had been placed on hold was when I faced two separate layoffs from the facility that I work at but the payments were always resumed.

Once the current administration first announced the student loan forgiveness plan, I applied for it and was approved. Then the lawsuit was filed against the administration over the forgiveness program and I received an email stating that my loans would still be forgiven after they won their case. That of course did not happen and my loans were not forgiven.

As I said, I work for a DOE government contractor and have for many years. Government contractors do not qualify for public service loan forgiveness which is a shame because we provided a public service for many years with uranium enrichment and now we provide a public service by cleaning up the environment that was contaminated during enrichment operations.

Also, as I previously stated, I have not taken out a student loan since around 2004/2005. That was 20 years ago. Millions of student loans have been forgiven under the current administration and I am asking you to please forgive mine. I was told they would be forgiven and that promise was taken away from me. So I am asking for you to look at my case and understand where I am coming from. I only owe a little more than $5,000. I would be more than appreciative for your time and understanding in this matter. I am having a hard time understanding how millions of loans can be forgiven but yet mine is still sitting there even after the initial promise of forgiveness.

Thank you,
April Wright

James Madison warned us of this in Federalist #10 when he noted the power of representative government to advance certain interests of factions over the good of the cizentry as a whole.  In addition to the clearly unconstitutional rule proposal, this plan punishes those people who did not go to college, paid off their loans, or succeeded in obtaining scholarships through individual achievements, by transferring wealth from this group to a favored faction as deemed by the President.  This is rife with moral hazards in addition to further indebting the nation at a time of national debt that exceeds 34 trillion dollars.

Direct Loan Program…” [Docket ID: ED-2023-OPE-0123], with the seven exceptions detailed below. 

(1) Please explicitly specify that qualifying for the waiver of outstanding principal balance exceeding the amount owed when the loan first entered repayment is based on adjusted gross income (AGI) as commonly prepared, and not modified AGI (MAGI), or some other computation. 

(2) Please ensure that the waiver of outstanding principal balance exceeding the amount owed when the loan first entered repayment can reduce capitalized interest. Not doing so is unfair to graduate students who spent longer in school. The DoE has not offered any subsidized graduate loans since 2011. Graduate students also face the interest that accrues on their unsubsidized undergraduate loans capitalizing upon ultimately entering repayment. My StudentAid.gov account is showing $27,000 in accrued interest, but this ignores the $56,518 in interest that was capitalized upon my first entering repayment in 2016. 

(3) Please un-cap the waiver of outstanding principal balance exceeding the amount owed when the loan first entered repayment so that it can provide relief beyond $20,000. This amount is insufficient and will particularly not rectify the interest burden faced by those with Direct Grad PLUS loans which had fixed interest rates of 7.90% until the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013. However, this effort was short-lived as rates crept back higher, with recent Direct Grad PLUS Loan disbursements having a rate of 8.05%. After 93 qualifying months in income-driven repayment (IDR), my loan balance has grown by $90,642 largely attributable to three of my six Direct Grad PLUS Loans having an interest rate of 7.65%. 

(4) Please build in a gradual phase out of the AGI to qualify for the waiver of outstanding principal balance exceeding the amount owed when the loan first entered repayment. For example, married couples filing jointly with an AGI between $240,001 and $300,000 should receive a waiver, albeit proportionally reduced. This will ensure fairness for borrowers working in high cost of living states. Not building in a gradual phase out creates an arbitrary cliff at $240,000. This is similar to how pre-2007 borrowers’ holding DoE-owned FFELP loans like myself were arbitrarily excluded from Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and stuck in Income-Based Repayment (IBR) until the One Time IDR Account Adjustment of 2024. A gradual phase out is essential since discretionary income for SAVE will continue to be calculated without consideration of federal and state income taxes, and the State and Local Tax cap has not been abolished. 

(5) Please revise SAVE the program such that married couples are able to file for their taxes jointly and then submit the W2 from their spouse to their servicer, to have the spouse’s federal taxable wage subtracted from the combined AGI for the borrower’s discretionary income computation, when the spouse does not have any federal student loans. Borrowers are not tax accountants, and the consequences of their wrong filing determination may be owing federal taxes (instead of a refund) or a year’s worth of incorrect IDR payments. 

(6) Please revise the SAVE program such that discretionary income is computed above the 400% FPL threshold to better reflect borrowers’ true discretionary income after housing, food, childcare, health insurance premiums, utilities, and transportation. While the 225% threshold was a welcome addition to the final rule, without consideration of state income taxes this disadvantages borrowers working in high cost of living states. Advanced premium tax credits from the ACA are available to households with incomes up to 400% of the FPL. These were expanded through 2022 by the ARPA and extended through 2025 by the IRA. HHS is being realistic in its assessment of affordability for lower- and middle-income households, and the DoE should follow suit in protecting more take-home pay for essential expenses. 

(7) Please revise the SAVE program such that the discretionary income share of 5% is expanded from undergraduate student loans to also cover graduate student loans. All types of federal student loan debt, both undergraduate and graduate, should receive equal treatment. By allowing undergraduate borrowers to pay a lower percentage of their discretionary income, the DoE penalizes graduate borrowers for getting an advanced degree and makes doing so more expensive. Graduate loans have higher interest rates than undergrad loans even though graduate borrowers are demonstrably less risky borrowers, and face double the discretionary income share as undergraduate borrowers that did not continue studies in graduate programs. Graduate borrowers should not be punished for taking on complex professions that require higher levels of education and a far greater debt burden. ","Federal Agency",,,,,,

I am hoping to get some relief with his proposal for people with a graduate degree started 25 years ago or more. I had all the best intentions of paying my loans consistently because I thought I would get a job in my field an could pay my loans regularly.

I was able to get a good job eventually after school but over the next 10 years, I went through a layoff every 1.5 to 2 years. I just couldn't get ahead. Interest would accrue even when I did a forbearance or deferral which has now made my loan $20K+ more than when I graduated.

I went through another layoff after that, and took a job with my local government for 4 years. That was a $45K cut in income compared to what I had been making but I needed the job. I Was grateful to HAVE a job and this helped me get through COVID because of it. 

I now have finally gotten back into the field of behavioral safety with a global safety and sustainability company DSS+ and am making very good money - finally. So I couldn't apply for the SAVE plan, but I just started making good money after all these years.

I just wanted to get this out to one of the agencies that has to service the loans and tell my story. If any or all of this could be forgiven, it would be so helpful and such a huge relief!

I am now on Medicare, and because of making such a good wage, my premiums have gone up nearly 50%. Prices are still an issue in gas, taxes, and groceries, so what looks like great money sure is getting eaten up in other increased costs.

I didn't get my BA until I was 43 years old. I graduated in 2011 at the height of a recession. I was not able to find a job for a long time and my degree made no difference at all.

I was able to get Pell grants for a few years, as my husband was active duty military and we had two young children. It took ten years to complete school, as I was a devoted military wife and mother. 

As my now ex-husband was promoted, I was no longer eligible for Pell grants. By the time I was done with school, I had over $50,000 in financial aid debt. I can assure you, my college and education was not worth $50,000. I do not even make that in a year even now.

It is frustrating to have student loans based on my ex-spouses income.  I supposed the same can be said for kids using their parent's income, which also isn't fair if the graduates don't make the expected income for having a degree. 

My first job out of college, which was also after my divorce, was making $8.50 an hour part time. I had to move to a small town with my parents after my divorce. I was panicked and decided to go back to school for court reporting. I nearly finished, while acquiring more debt, but for a hand injury which put that dream on indefinite hold.

I went back into the workforce full time in 2018. It was difficult finding a job at my age with no job experience. 

My credit took a huge hit after my divorce. I have worked hard to raise my credit score to 783. I only make $21.50 an hour, have a 401K, and company shares. I have considerable debt in addition to my student loans. My payments are over $1300 a month. After utilities and food, there isn't much left. I don't even pay rent, as my mom's home is paid for. I have no car payment at this time either.

At nearly 56 years old, and looming student loan payments of about $200 a month, the thought of saving for retirement is scary. I know I will work well into my 70s. 
I currently live with my elderly mother. I'm scared to death of having to repay this student loan, plus rent when she passes, plus all the debt I've been trying to pay off. I am making considerable progress which will nearly halt so that I can pay off student loans that may not be paid off in my lifetime.
I urge you to consider a person's age at the time of graduation. A 23 year old graduate is in a better place to pay off a loan than a 43 year old graduate. I have considerable less time to pay.
I also cannot remarry due to losing my military health benefits. Because of this, I have no chance of combining incomes to help me.

My company does not participate in the 401k matching program yet. That would have been a dream come true. My company only has 100 employees and they would have to hire someone to administer the program and there was not enough information provided for them to implement it yet. Making this program mandatory would go a long way for older people like myself.

I applied for the SAVE program and ended up with a higher payment that three years ago. There has not been any relief for me. I see people with loan forgiveness that make $200,000. What about the rest of us? The ones closer to retirement that really need help.

Please, help us.

I am pleased to hear about the student debt relief program. However, if im correct, this does not apply to private loans?

Here's my situation.. I started college at 17, with no knowledge of how financial aid, loans or ANY of that stuff worked. In order to get myself out of a financial bind (a hold on my academic account due to an unpaid bill,) I searched for any type of loan I could find so that I could continue getting my education. 
Unaware of what Sallie Mae really was (a private loan company) I chose my loan through them because they were the quickest and could get my money the soonest. 

Is there any way I could somehow take out a government loan to pay Sallie Mae and then apply for the debt relief program? 

I'm 20 years old and own a home, while trying to attend school full time and work.. I'm struggling to make payments. I don't owe a lot and my payment isn't too outrageous, but any little bit of relief would help tremendously.

Currently, dependent students can borrow a maximum of $31,000 of federal direct loans, while independent students (those over the age of 24, or otherwise special circumstances) can borrow up to $57,500. For both cases, only $23,000 of either amount can be in subsidized loan funds, which are those that prevent interest accruement until after graduation.

The plan to eliminate $20,000 would likely help hundreds of thousands of students who did manage to keep their borrowing to a minimum, and would even clear some students of debt entirely. This would stimulate economic freedom and flexibility for many Americans.

However, I think that there has not been enough attention on the Parent PLUS Borrowers. Are these individuals going to be subject to the debt relief as well? Shouldn't something be done to help these families? These loans are very generously offered to those that can pass a credit check, and are often UP TO cost of attendance. While certainly helpful to students without other options, I find that the varying interest rates each year for these loans was already high years ago, and just keeps getting higher. Students are borrowing massive Parent PLUS Loans, leaving their parents to bear the burden of these loans without anywhere near as many repayment options. 

Parent PLUS Loan borrowers only have the option of consolidations and income-contingent repayment, which I have seen offer absolutely NO relief to some families. A consolidation of loans with steadily increasing interest rates is a complete failure, and I think there is nowhere near enough education and information available to parents on the burden they are taking on for their child. I have personally watched my father's PLUS loan borrowings accrue over $8,000 in interest, even with the COVID pause on student loans. There is no way someone should allow this to continue.

Many people who cry out against this move do not seem to understand that the point of these loans is to help American people become more educated, providing greater opportunities and growth for everyone. These are not ""rich kids doing whatever they want and racking up thousands in debt that (they) now have to pay for"". These are Americans chasing a dream, students getting aid to get the college education that has been pushed into the minds of generation after generation as the best way to succeed, for people just looking for help in making a difference for themselves and those around them.

I am begging for this resolution to pass for everyone, and hoping that more regulation can be done in the future.

Students that attended college during the pandemic additionally had to pay full tuition for half the quality of a regular education. This is unfair for those students. These students were additionally misled into the false hope that their debts would be reduced, only for the Supreme Court to rule it unconstitutional.  

I'm not sure why there is debt that is being cancelled is for people that entered repayment over 20 years ago rather than people that graduated into unfair circumstances. Of course, there should be an affordable limit to how much debt is cancelled but overall those effected by negative circumstances such as the pandemic should be entitled to something.",,,,,,,

I have more than $60k in student loan debt. 
My mother is a college graduate. My father was incarcerated for the majority of my life and suffered from schizophrenia. I was raised on food stamps. I know what it’s like to struggle financially and live below the poverty line. College was my ticket to a better life for my family. With such an upbringing I did not have financial support from family members to go to college. Thus to make this happen, I took out student loans hoping to be able to provide a better life for my family.

I have two children under the age of 18 and a husband with a good job. 

My husband makes $120k a year.
I now make $40k a year. My vocational training as a Medical Assistant and Bachelor’s degree in social work allowed me to qualify for my current position at Cleveland Clinic working as a Cancer Research Coordinator. My husband has an associate’s degree in law enforcement but his higher paying career is in “industrial sales.” 

Not only did the high cost degree and technical training not result in high paying jobs for my husband or I but, these salaries are not enough to afford a home. We sold our families home in October 2021 after I lost my job during the pandemic (also in  manufacturing/industrial work) to get ahead on credit debt that accumulated during the pandemic. We now live with my mother in her home. We struggle to buy food to cook each week. We live paycheck to paycheck. 

Eliminating student loans in any capacity will change the course of our life. We have a modest retirement savings started. Our oldest daughter will graduate Highschool in 4 years. She wants to study botany and she has elected to participate in the NNDCC program at her school to hopefully offset the costs of her education. Our youngest daughter is going into 4th grade next year, she has dyslexia. Her motivation to work hard in school and over come barriers is that she wants to participate in the Disney college program and be a princess.

All of these goals come at a great cost.
We are good people. We are struggling. We are America.

Please help. 
Things are bad.
We believe our elected officials can make life better.

With fewer families burdened by debt related to education they are more readily able to make risky decisions that stand to improve the economy as a whole. The largest influencer of the outcome is currently inflation. While forgiveness stands to worsen inflation it may be with considering federal match of payments of borrowers  to loan distributors thereby quelling interest accumulation making loans more affordable and lessen the aggressiveness by which a total forgiveness might impact inflation rates.

Never was a payment explained that would provide a zero payment while allowing me to stay in repayment status. I could have qualified I think

My issue with the current status of my loans is that despite the reasonable payment and promise of interest reduction from the SAVE plan, my balance is still going up regardless of timely payments.  I originally borrowed around $35,000 under and graduate level combined but my total at one time was over $70,000.  Just cancel the interest and let me pay what I borrowed... that should be the solution for every borrower because 20 years later, I am still getting nowhere and will never be out of debt to the government.","Financial Aid Administrator",,,,,,

As a taxpayer, I oppose Joe Biden's unconstitutional, inequitable plan to corrupt the federal government into transferring the cost of others’ student loan debt onto me and every other American while he continues to drain our wallets through inflation. Now is not the time to force me to pay for someone else's financial decisions. 

Teaching young Americans not to be responsible for themselves and their own financial choices is bad guidance. This transfer of their responsibility to innocent taxpayers is Socialism. It teaches the borrowers to depend on the federal government.  

This regulation is illegal and unconstitutional. The Supreme Court already rejected the original debt transfer plan under the HEROES Act. In part, the decision reaffirmed Congress’ sole authority to take such drastic action. 

Biden calling this ""forgiveness"" leads the students to believe he is forgiving their debt, when he is not--he's transferring it unfairly to millions who never went to college or paid off their debt.

Worse, Biden is blatantly buying votes in this election-year scheme to bribe voters with the promise of free money—but it won’t work. I’m tired of this administration’s inflation-fueling agenda and complete disregard for the law and taxpayers.


I recommend the Department rescind this regulation. ",,,,,,,

I propose politicians pony up some big bucks for this - in other words, put your money where your mouth is.

Subject: Comment on Proposed Rulemaking for Student Debt Relief

I am a 19-year-old female student attending Indiana University. I am writing to express my strong support for the proposed rule ""Student Debt Relief for the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program,"" as it directly impacts students like me who are facing the daunting prospect of substantial loan repayments after graduation.

The cost of higher education has increased exponentially, leaving many of us worried about our financial futures. The proposed amendments offer a glimmer of hope for more manageable repayment plans and potential loan waivers under certain conditions. These changes are not only necessary but vital for the well-being of millions of students who wish to contribute positively to society without the crippling weight of debt.

I particularly appreciate the Department's consideration of loan forgiveness for borrowers with loans that have been in repayment for extended periods. This reflects an understanding of the prolonged economic challenges many face, especially during these uncertain times.

However, I am concerned about the clarity of eligibility criteria and the potential complexity of the application process. As a young borrower, I urge the Department to ensure the process is straightforward and well-communicated so that students can easily access the relief they are entitled to.

This rulemaking is a significant step towards a more equitable higher education system and offers much-needed support for students like myself.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide my perspective on this pivotal issue.

Sincerely,

Kaiya Deurloo

I have chosen an profession in public service and even chose a school not based on the title or level of education but solely on the bases of their affordability in retaining a undergraduate degree. I qualified for grants as low income and first generation college student and US born citizen . And while completing and receiving my BA have worked incredibly hard to move up in pay scale and corporate ladder. I desired a job in non profit and as we know the pay is not why we do what we do. But even if I’ve been able to afford living paycheck to paycheck the ability to pay back on my student loan has been non existent. The level in which inflation has impacted, my life expectancy. The economy and difficulty to break generational barriers as a child of immigrants has been beyond taxing. While I know my story is no different than many other out there. The fact that I cannot progress in my life to even own a home because the amount of student debt I have has paralyzed my husband and I from advancing as a couple. I urge you to consider the long term ramifications this will have on our economic growth if we stunt an entire generation from being able to invest in our economy. Living paycheck to paycheck as a college graduate who chose to go to an “affordable school “ is unacceptable. Allowing us this opportunity to cancel out even a small amount of debt can only help grow the economy as a generation will feel free to invest and spend in business that help further the American dream. 
I cannot even being to express the amount of gratitude and the long term impact it will make on giving our future generations the opportunity to go to affordable colleges and even local colleges for free.

As a current student who has taken on student loans, I am in favor of the latest Student Debt Relief program the Biden Administration has proposed. Student debt represents one of the most significant barriers to financial freedom for those who have completed their degrees. I believe that this program will help those who are most vulnerable to adverse loan impacts. I am especially appreciative for the provision in the proposed rule to erase the loans of individuals who qualify for other student debt relief programs. Not everyone is familiar with all of the benefits available to them, and this part of the regulation will ensure that countless people in need but without proper knowledge or access can find a way out. This provision, along with the others, will ensure that those who are most at risk of default will not have their financial lives destroyed by student debt. 

I hope that the Department is able to find a path forward for borrowers who are closer to the middle of society. While this regulation would represent an extremely important step in the correct direction, it would not assist the middle class. Protecting the middle class is extremely important for the health of the nation to combat inequality. I hope the agency continues to consider additional ways to put money back in the hands of everyday Americans.

My overall opinion is that some forgiveness should occur for those holding any type of federal student loan. However, my personal belief is that the Republican Party will fight every effort and this is likely a losing battle. What really needs to happen is to make colleges and universities partially responsible for student outcomes and retention, or risk losing access to those loans and federal grant dollars. There also needs to be policies to reign in tuition hikes. For those already sunk in debt, reigning in and forgiving large portions of interest alone will greatly reduce the financial strain felt by them. I myself took out about $35,000 as an undergrad at a out of state school. At the time, I believed I had a viable plan to pay it off, and had things gone my way, I probably would have. Instead, I wound up on disability for a good part of a decade before getting back on my feet. At the time, all Navient would do is put me in forbearance after forbearance. So, while I was trying to rebuild my life and get off of disability, a feat already stacked against those in that situation, I was forced to watch tens of thousands of dollars be capitalized and added to my overall balance. I was finally able to work, but was stuck in minimum wage or similar type jobs given most of my twenties had no work history. So, I had to go to grad school to ""reset"" my life, and it worked! I now have a salaried job (about 52k a year, but a vast improvement over minimum wage) and actual healthcare! Today, my balance is about 95k, 40k of which is capitalized interest. I was able to do the PSLF temporary waiver as I did do two AmeriCorps terms and a few minimum wage state park seasonal jobs in my early thirties (Navient claimed at the time that full time but seasonal work didn't count toward PSLF, so I hadn't applied) as I was developing working skills, and after graduating with my masters in 2022, got the job I have now at a non-profit. In total, with TEPSLF and PSLF, I have 75 out of 120 payments toward PSLF. Biden, you MUST protect and solidify these waiver counts NOW! My fear, should the election not go your way, is that Republicans will toss those away simply out of retribution. Please safeguard these counts and protect PSLF. For me, it is my only hope. I am 3 years and 7 months from forgiveness. I'll be 42. Maybe then, I can maybe buy a house? Also, though this no longer applies to me, something must be done to stop interest growth for those on SSD or SSDI. I could not claim total and permanent disability because i knew, even with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, that I could have a life, and life on SSDI is miserable, and I wanted so badly to be off it. For those on disability, whether permanent or not, ALL interest on federally held loans should be stopped. Luckily, thanks to your SAVE plan, my interest is finally not growing and payments are affordable. Due to my condition, I never bothered dating, much less marrying, so I am on just my salary of 52k a year. Please make sure to not only protect waiver counts and PSLF from ""Revenge of the Republicans"" but also this amazing and life changing payment plan as well. Tell Republicans we are not all ""rich"" college graduates. Only the poorest had to borrow and most like myself, make below the national average of $75,000 a year. Tell them I did exactly what they praise. I got off of government assistance, Medicaid and Medicare. I got off food stamps and low income housing. Isn't that what Republicans always claim they want people to do? Well, I did that. Against all odds and an uphill battle with Social Security (who I now supposedly owe 5k in overpayments to, but that is a whole other issue). You tell them I did that, without help. And now, the only lifeline I have to finish stabilizing my life and actually HAVE a life, may well be threatened by conservative indifference. So yes, forgive whatever you can legally get away with, and then set up protections for that forgiveness so that Republicans can not claw back all the progress you have made. Then make THEM come up with a plan to make college and trade school more affordable. An uneducated or indebted society cannot hope to compete in the global market. It is time for the United States to join the 21st century. ","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,

I’m 26 years old and was accepted for the loan forgiveness plan back in 2022 however the bill wasn’t passed, that was such a slap in the face because I wasn’t prepared to pay my loans after being accepted for PSLF. I went to cosmetology school and paid for courses that didn’t benefit me at all. I thought I would learn something that I can use in my business, Instead we were taught skills that were useful in the 1990s. After graduating I had to pay out of my pocket for certifications and courses that give more knowledge on New generation hairstyless, facials, makeup, nail art, and etc. This program will give so many people a relief because a lot of students who paid for school either are still looking for a job in the field they studied or is working with a job who pays minimum wage along with the U.S inflation; regardless of lower or higher payments an individual will gain interest that’ll make payments impossible to pay off.","Financial Aid Administrator",,,,,,

The public service loan forgiveness plan does benefit those students and graduates, but 120 payments is a long time for a person in a low income job (as most public service jobs are lower income).  Cutting down the number of payments required would encourage future students going into those vocations which are often short and difficult to fill.  Cutting the months by half would greatly better the lives of those working, help fill those positions.  Case in point:  I went into School Psychology to be able to work in the schools and help students with disabilities.  I am also an older student and have graduated, but still cannot afford to pay my monthly payment on my student loan ($1200) because I am on the bottom of the pay scale for a School Psychologist, I now have to pay $2500 in rent because the housing prices have skyrocketed and have to also take care of a disabled child.  It could be worse and have to take care of my aging parents, that is yet to come.  I have over $180,000 in student loans and only have a specialist degree.  I can't afford to go for my doctorate degree, because I need at least 10 years of payments/work in to get it forgiven before I retire in 13 years if I work until I am 70 years old.","Financial Aid Administrator",,,,,,

I attended The Art Institute of Washington. I was pressured and coerced into attending this school.  I attended the school to seek a degree in Bachelor of Fine Arts for Graphic Design only to find out that the degree is worthless to the industries in the Graphic Design field. While attending there I was promised employment opportunities in Graphic Design that were only given to The Art Institute’s Career Services by employers.  only to find out that the job opportunities given to me by The Art Institute could be found on any career opportunity website or Craigslist. The Art Institute of Washington clearly misled me into believing that the degree I would receive would allow me job opportunities in the Graphic Design field.  It’s been years and I have never been able to apply for or have a job in the Graphic Design field with the degree I received from The Art Institute. The Art Institute’s program degrees are worthless to students seeking  jobs opportunities with these degrees.  They only find out when applying for the jobs that they were not qualified with these degrees.  The Art Institute of Washington and all The Art Institutes are frauds. They deceived innocent people for the sake of making a profit and giving their students nothing in return but school loan debt, misleading information from classes, to teachers, to job opportunites They did not care about the students that trusted them. The Art Institutes have been found to be guilty of numerous unethical behaviors, explaining why and is proof why the many campuses have been closed down. I am, therefore, for Student Debt Relief for all students that were defrauded by their school. ",,,,,,,

This was for my second year (3 semesters) of a Master's degree. I had paid off all of my own and my husband's student loans prior to having to finance the second year of the program due to divorce.  I competed my program in 2013, started IBR 6 months later, in which as a single parent with 3 dependents in my household, my required monthly payments were $0, yet the interest accrued. At sometime I switched to the PAYE. I now hold almost $10,000 in accrued interest on my initial $20,000 loan. 

I have found only certain particular non-profits and government positions qualify for forgiveness. I did work for a non-profit, One80 Place (homeless shelter), for about 4 months which never qualified me for any forgiveness. In January 2015, I began working on a SCA contract for the U.S.C.G.. I worked in that position until I was laid off due to terminating the position in October 2018. I worked the 2020 Census, initially as a field worker doing address canvassing operations (July 2019-August 2019), then as a Field Manager in charge of Group Quarters from October 2019 to October 2020. In February 2021, I began a position with NCI INC. on the GSA DIGITS contract and left that position in October 2021 to return to my previous position on the SCA Contract with the U.S.C.G. which I have worked since. My calculations are that I have worked in positions that should have received forgiveness credit for 7 years and 9 months.
As a contract employee, I am employed according to the SCA, my pay is determined by the SCA wage determinations for my location and position title. I receive a taxed as income health and wellness (H&W) benefit that is also determined by the DOL. My employer does not provide me any benefits, incentives, rewards, bonuses, or recognitions as they are not required to. I do a job that would otherwise be filled by a GS employee that would be provided full benefits. 

At this time I am 50 years old, I am in basically in a dead end job working for the government My net income is around $55000 a year since I am single. I have 2 kids in college who I help when I can, and a home for when they need it, yet no dependents. I have no retirement, no healthcare/vision/dental (Marketplace prices me at over $20,000 a year for just myself premium & deductible, H&W pay after taxes is around $7000 (to cover all benefits including retirement)).  I don't try to live outside my means, yet I am going to have to choose repaying my student loans over healthcare as my income is over the threshold for being single. I am also going to have to repay all the accrued interest as I have followed the program for over 10 years now. I have 20 years of degreed credentials, have paid for everything except the one year that is my current student loan debt. ","Congress",,,,,,

Like many, I have navigated the daunting terrain of financing an education through loans—amassing over $210,000 in debt from undergraduate studies to an MBA, acquired between 1997 and 2012. My journey was fraught with financial hurdles: I grew up in a single-parent household, my mother battling multiple sclerosis, and my father absent. With no parental financial support, I worked two jobs while pursuing my degrees, a testament to my commitment to education despite the heavy cost of tuition and living expenses.

Living in Silicon Valley, the stark reality of my circumstances is exacerbated by the high cost of living. Here, those of us passionate about working in the nonprofit or education sectors find ourselves penalized for our contributions to society, struggling to afford basic housing while supporting our families and, in my case, a disabled mother on a meager Social Security income. This proposed bill offers a beacon of hope not just for individuals like myself, burdened by unsustainable debt, but for our broader community. It represents a profound shift towards recognizing and alleviating the financial duress that stifles the potential of countless Americans.

Senator Bernie Sanders has long advocated for the necessity of education reform, emphasizing that ""Education should be a right, not a privilege."" This proposal echoes his vision by aiming to dismantle the barriers that lock so many into the poverty cycle. Forgiveness of student loans as outlined in this bill would not only liberate me and others from the shackles of debt but would also empower us to invest in careers that truly benefit society. Instead of being forced into high-paying jobs misaligned with our passions just to make ends meet, we could pursue meaningful work in fields like education and non-profit sectors, directly contributing to the community and making a real difference.

The impact of this bill extends beyond individual debt relief; it is about transforming lives and enabling a future where our talents and energies can be channeled towards the greater good of society. This is not just about financial relief; it's about restructuring our society to uplift those weighed down by the burden of educational costs. It's about giving us the freedom to support our families and contribute to our communities without the looming shadow of debt.

I urge swift passage of this transformative legislation. It's time to turn a new page in how we approach higher education financing in America, providing real, tangible relief to those of us committed to bettering ourselves and our society through education.",,,,,,,

Many of us in order to go to college had to get student loans because of the economic status of our parent(s).  In my case, a family of 6 with a household income slightly above poverty I felt that college was the answer to help me achieve an economic status where I could afford to pay back my student loan.  My Sallie Mae federal loan balance was less than $9,000 in 1991.  After numerous forbearances I’m still paying on my student loan.   Today that $9,000 loan has ballooned to over $40,000 including interest and fees for going in default and sold to a different lender.  After over 8 years of payments of approximately $385 per month my loan balance is approximately $38,000. Payoff date isn’t until 2040, another 16 years.. I didn’t fully understand the extent of this arrangement but was told this was my only option to keep my income from being garnished If I couldn’t pay the total amount due on the loan.  So, this is the repayment arrangement that was made to get me out of default. $385 for another 16 years equal approximately $73,900.  If nothing changes I will pay over $100K on a $9,000 student loan.  How is that legal or fair????  This is an example of why a Student Debt Relief Act is needed for people that don’t qualify under any other loan forgiveness program. There needs to be help for people like me in this situation.   I’m requesting debt relief.

At first I was going to community college and paying for school out of pocket. Once I started going to a university, I had no choice but to take student loans. My plan was to only take two years at a university so I wouldn't rake up student debt. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I ended up being enrolled for four years instead. The main reason was I had to switch schools. My schedule was being disorganized by my former counselor, to the point where I would still be in school if I didn't switch. My plan of trying to save money fell apart, and now that I am trying to get my life together and attempt to pay this massive debt, everything around me has skyrocketed regarding to price. It is going to be very difficult for me to try and move out on my own, pay for bills, and pay for my student debt. It feels like I am stuck and it will take me another 10 years to try and accomplish anything, like owning a house or even have children. Even half of debt relieved would be a huge help and I can finally start being a productive member of society. ","Congress",,,,,,

According to The Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (31 U.S.C. 951-953), the responsibility for collecting debts owed to the United States arising from administrative activities falls on the respective federal agencies. 

The new student loan forgiveness plan effectively shifts this responsibility from borrowers to taxpayers, undermining the Act's purpose. The Federal Claims Collection Act mandates that federal agencies pursue the collection of debts owed to the United States, ensuring due diligence and fairness in the process. 

The proposed rule flagrantly neglects this duty in pursuit of a policy objective not authorized by law, for the apparent political purpose of turning out younger voters for President Biden.

Lastly, let me add a personal note. I paid back EVERY PENNY of MY student loans, WITH INTEREST! Now, forty (40) years later, you are telling me that I have to subsidize a bunch of freeloaders, who made the same promise I did, but can't seem to handle the truth. They took out the loans, got their diplomas, and now they want to wriggle out of their obligations because they suddenly realize that the choices they made have consequences! Well, too bad! No one forced you to accumulate debts beyond your ability to pay, because you wanted to major in a useless field, with no prospects for gainful employment, at a private college or university, with a six-figure tuition bill! I went to a state university, got a degree in Electrical Engineering, and paid back my loans early! Well, the free ride's over. Buckle up, buttercup! 

I urge you to withdraw your proposed plan to dump student loan debt on taxpayers.",,,,,,,

Dear Regulations.gov Team,

I hope this correspondence finds you well. I am writing to express my situation regarding my student loan, which originated from my enrollment at Heald College. At the age of 19, I embarked on this educational journey with aspirations of securing a better future for myself. However, circumstances beyond my control have led me to a path of financial struggle and uncertainty.

I graduated from Heald College with an Associate's Degree in Computer Business Administration in 1999 where I learned how to use Word, Excel, Powerpoint and how to type 50wpm and write letters.  Currently, for these skills, I owe $38,000 approximately.  I also acheived general education courses by they that are not tranferable. 

Upon graduation, I encountered difficulties in securing employment in my field of study that could sustain me financially. Despite my efforts, the skills I acquired did not yield the lucrative opportunities I had envisioned. Instead, I found myself working in various restaurants to make ends meet. At times, I had to juggle up to four jobs simultaneously to cover my expenses.

Over the years, the burden of my student loan has only escalated, reaching nearly $40,000 with accrued interest. This substantial debt has cast a shadow over my financial stability, hindering my ability to progress in life. Furthermore, the closure of Heald College in 2015 exacerbated my predicament, leaving me with a non-transferable degree and no avenue for credit transfer.

The impact of this student loan debt permeates various aspects of my life. It has thwarted my dreams of homeownership and impeded my ability to save for future endeavors, such as investments or retirement planning. The weight of this debt has also taken a toll on my mental and emotional well-being, leading me to seek therapy for feelings of worry, hopelessness, and depression.

Despite these challenges, I have persevered. Before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I secured a well-paying job, albeit outside my field of study. However, the pandemic brought unforeseen hardships, leading to a period of unemployment. Nevertheless, I have diligently worked to rebuild my life and pursue further education at the local community college but without transferable units I will have to start over with general education.  

Just as I resumed my duties at work, I faced an injury that sidelined me, and I am only now returning to work from that setback. While I am grateful for the opportunity to work, it feels like there's always another obstacle to overcome.

In light of my circumstances, I earnestly request consideration for student loan forgiveness and any input is greatly appreciated. The closure of Heald College, coupled with my enduring financial hardships, underscores the necessity for relief. I have diligently strived to overcome the obstacles life has thrown my way, but this student loan continues to impede my progress.

Thank you for reading my comment.

Sincerely, Rissa

I attended The Art Institute of Washington. I was pressured and coerced into attending this school.  I attended in order to receive a degree from The Art Institute of Washington in Fine Arts for Game Art Design only to find out that the degree is worthless to the industries in Game Art Design. While attending there I was promised employment opportunities by The Art Institute’s Career Services in the Game Art Design field only to find out after attending nearly two years that when I would return to my home state that there were no employment opportunites for Game Art Design in my home State. The Art Institute of Washington clearly misled me into believing that the degree I would receive would allow me job opportunities in the Game Art Design that only companies gave to The Art Institute. It’s been years and I have ever been able to apply for or have a job in the Game Art Design field.  The Art Institute’s program degrees are worthless to students who sought jobs with the degrees only to find out they were not qualified for the jobs with these degrees.  The Art Institute of Washington and for that matter, all The Art Institutes are frauds. They preyed on innocent people in order to make a profit and giving nothing in return but school loan debt, misleading information from classes, to teachers. They did not care about the human beings that trusted them. The Art Institutes have been found guilty of numerous unethical behaviors, which explains why the many campuses have been closed down. I am, therefore, for Student Debt Relief for all students that were defrauded by their school. ",,,,,,,

I attended college from 1995-1998 and left that school with a student loan debt of $36,000.00. I had been repaying it and then had a decline in income and instead of offering me a lower payment, I was forced to go into forbearance. Of course, we all know that interest continues to accrue. I then had to claim bankruptcy and the Trustee was sending payments of over $500.00 monthly for five years to the loans that I never saw credited on the accounts so I am not sure where my money went and could not get an answer from the loan servicer. There was $25,000.00 tacked onto my loan when I filed bankruptcy for ""attorney fees"" even though my loan was not included in the bankruptcy. Now my $36,000.00 debt is up to $190,000.00 (more than my mortgage on my house) and I do not see an end in sight. I am in the IDR plan as I only make $43,000.00 annually but feel this will never be paid. 
The interest and fees tacked onto the loans is downright corrupt and should be illegal! I took out a loan for a specific amount and should not have to pay for all these ridiculous fees and astronomical interest amounts. The other issue is there is no option to refinance my loan at a lower rate without losing ALL the payments I have made under the IDR plan to count and continue in the plan. I am currently at 8.25% which is another area of robbery. This should not be allowed to be an interest rate for student loans. We want to better our future generations but do not support them in higher education - and all the taxes we pay - where does that help us? I have told both my children to NOT attend college as they will be in debt all their lives and instead pursue a trade.   ","Other",,,,,,

I am writing to request debt relief for my outstanding student loans under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, the Federal Family Education Loan Program, the Federal Perkins Loan Program, and the Health Education Assistance Loan Program.

As of now, my outstanding principal stands at $29,690.92, with an additional interest of $3,520.67. The burden of this debt has been overwhelming, making it challenging to make ends meet and pursue my goals effectively.

Given the current economic challenges and uncertainties, I believe that debt relief would significantly alleviate my financial stress and allow me to focus more on contributing positively to society rather than being weighed down by financial obligations.

I kindly request your assistance in exploring options for debt relief or forgiveness programs available to me. Your consideration and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to my request.

I received my bachelors degree in December 1997 and my masters degree in 2015. I have balances on both loans which are getting higher by the year. I am 72 years old and on social security and a small pension. My overall student loan debt is $84,000.00. There is no possible way I can pay this off within my life time. After graduation, I remained on my job which was not a public service job. It made a little more money than starting a job within my field (counseling). Therefore after all of these years of making payments, I did not qualify for forgiveness. I just ask if you would consider student loan forgiveness for those that are in the same dilemma that I am in.

I applaud your efforts to help student loan borrowers who have seen interest outrun their ability to pay. I am a borrower whose original amount was $48,846 when graduating with a master's in 2012. Since then I've been able to pay off $25,929. However, my total balance remains high at $42,399 because most of what I already paid was interest and not principal. 

I understand that your proposal will target current interest on loans, but will it also consider past interest paid? Since moving into an IDR plan, my interest has stopped accumulating and I only have $1,575 currently. So, I fear that your program won't be a strong help to people in my situation. Could you please consider allowing payments made in the past to apply toward the principal balance? If so, it would reduce my loan balance to $22,917 and accurately reflect how much I've already paid off. 

Thank you for your consideration of this proposal. I'm sure there are many other borrowers who are in my situation and would greatly appreciate the recognition of what we have done to pay off our loans.

Sincerely,

Kiah Dana","Individual",,,,,,

Growing up in the late 80s and early 90s. We were sold the idea of college. It was part of pop culture in America as well as discussed by every politician and grown up in my life. ""Go to college get a degree and you will have a better life"". Yet, nobody explained how interest rates worked. Nobody explained the long-term effects of loans. I was told by my counselors to take out the max amount each semester and to not leave money on the table. That way it would help me with buying books, a computer, help with the high gas prices, and even help cover part of my rent. This would all make my learning experience easier and less stressful. Had I known all these years later that I would be strapped with 70+ thousand dollars in loans and how impossible it would be to make a monthly payment in today’s economy. I would have never gone to school. Higher education was once subsidized by the states and a kid could work in fast food and pay off their loans often in the same year. Once all this changed the burden was squarely put on the future generations of this country. Who thought this was a good idea? Who thought to burden kids with that sort of debt at such a young age. Most of us end up working in fields that later on we find out we didn’t even need a degree to work in. Our nation is now pushing employers to offer more on the job training and skip higher education all together. Another point I would like to make is that I have been working with adults with special needs in a group home environment now for over a decade. Yet, the company I work for is not a non-profit, so I do not qualify for the public service forgiveness. I do the same work as others do and yet because of the type of business I work for I do not get the same benefit Why? I do not profit from the business I work for. I get a paycheck just like those who work for a non-profit do.  I am now almost 40 with 3 children and between my wife and I we can barely keep a roof above our heads as it is. So, I am absolutely in favor of loan forgiveness. It is time to reset things right in this country and stop crushing people with debt that they often do not really understand the ramifications of early in life.  ","Other",,,,,,

The lenders should be the ones “forgiving” the loans that students have more than paid for. The government should not be “forgiving” the loans at taxpayer expense. This rewards the unethical practices of the lenders. Require the lenders to wipe the debts clean, and implement a system to prevent lenders from doing this again. Otherwise, you are rewarding the bad behavior of lenders and you can expect to see it again.

In view of all the student debt relief you propose, I believe it may hurt some of the public service loan forgiveness programs that have helped place people in underserved areas. Why would the new graduate follow through with going to an underserved area when their debt can be wiped free with these “new” programs? Sometimes new graduates find they love working in the underserved area and live out their careers there. This is a win - win.

Finally, I ask that you consider the lifetime earning potential of a college graduate. Compare that to someone with less education. People with a high school diploma or less, and some two-year program or trade school graduates will be paying on student loans of people with the potential to earn far more money than they ever will over their lifetime, and likely a more comfortable life as well.

I understand the PSLF legislation was passed in October of 2007, but it seems patently unfair for those of us who began our careeers before, then.   Even though I have 11 years of public service, I only have 8 years of eligibility under the program.

I don't believe student loans were ever meant to be a lifelong debt, but sadly that's how it ends up for most student loan holders who were not privileged.

Student loan debt is the heaviest weight holding college graduates (and college dropouts) back from creating wealth in this country.  Combined with cost of living increases and cost of borrowing increases, it's extremely difficult to save, contribute to retirement, and contribute to next generations with the current student debt crisis.

Something has to change.  If the US wants to outperform other countries in education (we currently lag) then we have to make college more accessible without the burden of lifelong debt.","Individual",,,,,,

Like thousands of others, I have encountered numerous roadblocks along the way and have had to consistently reinvent myself to stay on track. Taking out a student loan was a decision I made with the aim of advancing my career, job opportunities, and income level, all while ensuring that I could care for and provide for my loved ones.

Now, at 63 years of age, I find myself burdened by a loan that has exponentially increased due to interest, making it nearly impossible to afford payments despite my diligent efforts. Furthermore, the stagnant wages and rising costs of goods and transportation only exacerbate the financial strain. I wholeheartedly support President Biden's efforts to provide some form of student loan forgiveness or relief. It's evident that the true beneficiaries of this system are the universities, colleges, and government entities.

Moreover, injecting money back into the hands of individuals will stimulate economic growth, benefiting communities as a whole. As a taxpayer, I have contributed to various government subsidy programs and public school taxes, regardless of whether I directly benefited from them. I have never hesitated to support these initiatives if they can help someone else. It's time for those who oppose student loan relief to acknowledge the systemic inequities and consider the significant contributions made by individuals like myself.

After years of hard work and dedication, I believe I have fulfilled my obligations towards my student loan. It's now imperative that congress address the systemic issues at hand and provide relief to those who have been burdened by the weight of student debt.","Congress",,,,,,

That loan at this point has sky rocketed to 34,199.34 since with the government taking most of my federal taxes since. I have been on multiple low income planes that have always failed because I've always been in the poverty level of yearly income and was never able to use my certification from my school. This was because of personal reasons and the inability to be away from my new daughter for any period of time. Im currently dealing with health and physical issues that keep me from currently working.  Though my loans are in deferment,they are still acquiring interest and I have no way to pay such a large a.ount of ever. If I don't get this debt relief plan I will not only see this loan just get larger and larger, It will also follow me for the rest of my life. I would love to go back to school and obtain a four year degree, but there is no way I can with the cost of school and the amount in which I already owe. I'm 48 years old as of tomorrow and can't afford to live let alone pay off thus debt. The interest alone is almost as much as the original loan I obtained and that's with maybe a thousand dollars a year in federal taxes being taken from me for close to twenty years. This will never get paid off. I'm on the verge of filing for disability and even if I get well enough to work it won't be enough to live let alone pay a loan that's twice the a.ount it was when I obtained it. It's almost comical what our country does to low income people who struggle paycheck to paycheck and can never get ahead. I havnt worked since the pandemic started and now I've obtained issues from that a.ount of time not working. I have social anxiety,depression and I don't want to leave my home. I need at least a majority of this loan to be forgiven if not all of it or I'll never have a chance. A chance to build my credit the rest of my life. A chance to get a degree without being put in a worse position. Most of our government has little concern for a person like me or its people in general. They say they are there to help and run this country, but it seems they are there to reap the benefits of the status they acquired many times through lies and manipulation. I believe I qualify for complete debt relief from these ridiculous loans for all the reasons I've stated above. If I can hardly get by and make sure my daughter has what she needs. Does the government really think me and the millions like me will ever pay off these loans? It's become completely ridiculous and I will never get out from under the interest alone unless our ( for thr people) government stands up and shows that its people are more important than the foreign wars and all our money that is bled out to causes in countries other than our own. We are seem to be last in line when it comes to the support of our own elected officials.  I doubt anyone will read this and I doubt any thing will change. All I can do I'd hope that someone, someday will reach out and repair our broken system and put the people first instead of us being last in line holding out an empty hand.

I made some poor decisions in my early 20s, and as a result, I lost all my scholarships. However, I got my life on track, graduated with high honors from a small college in Michigan, and I've been completely sober for 17 years. The last few years of college were very expensive, and my parents could not help me financially. I took on all those loans myself, and then I went to graduate school. As I became more financially stable and responsible, I started repaying my loans as best I could, but by then, accrued interest had catapulted my loans to over $100K. Now, I pay a very high monthly loan payment, which prevents me from investing in property, retirement, or other things. I'm not poor, but I'm not rich either, and I keep my debt as low as possible and live within my means. Lowering my student debt would enable me to invest more in the economy!

However, I urge and plead for the Biden Administration and Education Department to make Public Service Loan Forgiveness program improvements - either add to this proposal or as a separate action.

The Biden Administration has been unable to pass wide-scale loan forgiveness. Expanding the PSLF would be a meaningful step in supporting millions of Americans who were counting on, but are not going to receive, loan forgiveness. 

Expansion of the PSLF could take many forms:
1. Reduce the required number of payments from 120 (10 years) to, say, 84 (7 years).

2. Count each month in AmeriCorps, Peace Corps, the military, and similar programs as double towards the PSLF (e.g., 11 months in AmeriCorps = 22 eligible payments towards the PSLF). Citizens in these programs are making deep, profound sacrifices for our nation (many in AmeriCorps qualify for food stamps; serving in the Peace Corps has a higher mortality rate than the CIA). Yes, they do have qualifying $0 payments thanks to recent PSLF changes, but benefits should go much, much farther

3. Count all months of frozen COVID-era payments towards the PSLF, regardless of where one worked. This would effectively reduce the number of required payments from 10 to 7. There are many gaps and issues with the PSLF, and this would be an easy, one-time way to make up for many of them.

4. Allow time in graduate school to count towards the PSLF. Most in graduate programs are taking a full course load, on top of working part time and/or doing internships. A Masters of Social Work requires a full course load, plus 16 hours per week of usually unpaid internships. Allow loads put in forbearance during a graduate program to count as eligible payments.

5. If needed, the above time in graduate school proposal could be limited to certain service fields of study that strengthen our nation: time working towards a Masters in education, social work, public policy, public health, etc. Individuals in these programs are taking on significant debt to get low-paying positions solely because they hope to improve our nation. 

6. Repair the loopholes that make many federal contractors' payments ineligible. For example, USAID employs thousands of federal contractors. They are usually paid on a ""GS equivalent"" scale: they do essentially the same work and are paid the equivalent of actual federal employees, except without all the benefits of being a federal employee. There are major inequalities: in the Office of HIV/AIDS, about 3/4 of employees are contracted through a private company (Credence Management), and 1/4 through a nonprofit (PHI). This means that all contracts whose funds are funneled through Credence do not qualify for PSLF payments, while those through PHI do. There is no difference in their work or pay, it is simply a coin flip for which contracting organization manages the payment of a certain position. This is a tremendous inequity and problem in the organization. 

Expanding the PSLF and repairing its loopholes would positively impact millions. Further, the PSLF can be considered a ""means-tested"" program, which will reduce pushback against its expansion. It would be a major step towards fulfilling the Biden Administration's promise of loan forgiveness. It would avoid legal challenges. It would be simple to implement. It would inspire individuals who might otherwise not consider a life of public service to engage in it.

A major PSLF overhaul would solve nearly every issue with loan forgiveness, provide financial support to those struggling with our increased cost of living, be simple to implement, and avoid the concerns of those resistant to general loan forgiveness. 

Please consider this! Thank you for your time.

RE: Student Loan Dispute with University of Phoenix in SLC, UT

I was alerted that there is a class action lawsuit against many ""Universities"" that made claims that we not accurate, University of Phoenix was one of those who were required to refund education fees for misrepresenting their service.

I attended University of Phoenix and received my Bachelor's Degree in Business Management. I subsequently sent out 250+ resume's all over the US in an attempt to get a job. I have the experience in the field of event management necessary to be hired by any company; as soon as I mentioned on the application that my degree was acquired from The University of Phoenix, and was my only advanced degree at that time, I was not given any serious consideration. Out of the 250+ resumes I sent out, I was given 3 interiews and did not get a single job. My $50,000 + with interest in fees paid to University of Phoenix was a complete waste of time and money. It is not a respected degree and frankly reflects poorly on me. 

I am requesting a full refund plus interest for all fees paid to the University of Phoenix. I am unable to afford to seek a better degree due to the massive debt I have acquired at this point. 

I am on a income driven repayment plan at this time and due to very low income, Social Security, my payment is not required for now. But I can not continue to have this debt hanging over me when it was a zero benefit to my employment. It was absolutely not what was promised. ","Financial Aid Administrator",,,,,,

I agree with the Student Debt Relief for the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Direct Loans), the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, the Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins) Program, and the Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) Program, and would like to see the program implemented.

After borrowing $40,000 and paying back $32,000, how could my balance be $56,000? It is because of the interest, especially capitalized interest. Capitalized interest should be eliminated retroactively, in the present and for the future. Capitalized interest on student loans should be banned.

Predatory for-profit colleges and student lending practices have left so many of us out here with enormous debt for low-value or no-value degrees, so it will be great for a portion of our country to be free of that debt. The school that issued my bachelor degree (Argosy University) has closed amid years of scandal; even if I value the education that I received (despite my inability to ever get work in my desired industry), it's likely that potential employers will view that school negatively, casting disdain on my application materials. I still have 15-20 years before I can retire, so this is a legitimate problem.
  
I do have a revision recommendation for regulation 30.81. I think would be beneficial to wipe out all capitalized interest from the life of a loan. As a small example: I have been paying on my loan since 2006 (with a couple deferment or forbearance periods due to divorce and job layoffs, and a period of time where I paid interest-only payments). I've paid $27K to Navient for a $32K loan, and somehow still owe $28K. Conveniently, Navient does not appear to have reflected in my record any amount of interest that was capitalized on my loans over the years, but surely that could be calculated by the DOE.

Additionally, compounding interest is a predatory practice that should be eliminated from all student lending programs. Transitioning to a simple interest method rather than compounding interest would still earn both the servicers and the government ample amounts of money while being easier for borrowers to understand and actually pay off within a reasonable amount of time. 

It's unfortunate that the initial forgiveness program was shot down, but hopefully this will bring relief to a wider swath of our fellow Americans.

    I write to say thank you for trying to assist those of us who have been struggling to pay massive student loan debts. I have been in and out of work since turning middle-aged. Women working in financial services do not get the salaries and promotions that men get so the higher income I thought I would have to pay grad school debt never materialized. I am 57 and have never been able to buy my own home, in large part due to student loans and illegal sex discrimination on the job.
   Over covid and even now, I may have wild swings in salary due to unemployment so I am asking you not to base forgiveness on salary alone as salary can change drastically from one year to another for those of us who are “last hired, first fired”. I received (on paper) a salary of $129,000 last year. Sounds great but a large chunk of it was severance pay. The year before, I made around $42,000. 
    I am disclosing these personal details to demonstrate why forgiveness or other assistance for student loans should not be based on annual salary: it is an extremely arbitrary measure of someone’s economic situation.

I am not here looking for a handout and I don't believe that anyone should.  I borrowed money to pay for my education.  I received that education and I believe that I should pay that money back.  I believe what separates this new proposal from the plan that was proposed back in 2022, however, is that it intends to erase some or all the debt that exceeds the initial loan amount.  In other words, the banks should not be profiting from crushing interest that accrues because the borrowers could not afford to pay their loans each month.  I am one such borrower.

I went back to school in 2004 after several layoffs, a bad job market, and bankruptcy pushed me down that path.  In that time, I earned a couple of additional undergraduate degrees in 2007, but because the job market was still bad at that point, I stayed and got a master's degree as well.  My degrees are not ""useless"" degrees.  My undergraduate degrees were in biology and chemistry and my master's degree was in bioinformatics.  These are valuable degrees with high earning potential, but I didn't magically start making boatloads of cash when I graduated.  Because the market was still not great, it took me nearly 3 years to get a professional job.  Meanwhile, I was earning less than $30,000/year.  My first professional job took me out to California where I started at less than $60,000/year, which is next to nothing in California.  I was only paid once a month and I literally had to borrow money from friends one month so I could afford to buy food until I got my next paycheck.  Not a proud moment.  My income slowly increased over the years and in 2018, I was finally earning over $100,000/year.  Then in 2020, of course, student loan payments and interest were halted for 3 years because of COVID-19.

When I received my master's degree in 2008, my initial loan balance was a little over $60,000, but during the years where I couldn't afford to make my payments, the accrued interest drove the balance up over $115,000.  Now that payments have resumed, I am able to make my payments and I am making them.  The whole point of this new proposal, however, is to prevent interest from accumulating in the way it did for me, nearly doubling the amount of my initial loan balance.  Paragraph 30.81 states that the full amount of the loan that exceeds the initial loan amount will be waived for those on an income-driven repayment plan if their filing status is single and they earn less than $120,000/year.  I earn more than that today, so I don't qualify for an income-driven repayment plan, so this paragraph doesn't apply to me.  Otherwise, up to $20,000 can be waived as per paragraph 30.82.  While that would certainly be good, it's only $20,000 of the $55,000 in interest that has accrued since 2008.

I don't think you can draw an absolute line in the sand at $120,000/year and say that if somebody falls above that line today and if they're not on an income-driven repayment plan, they don't qualify.  I think you need to look at the whole picture.  In my case, yes, I fall above that line today, but in the years where all that interest was being piled on, I wasn't making anywhere close to $120,000/year.  It wasn't until recently that my salary grew to that level.  Is it fair that I should be crushed by interest because of financial hardship like so many others, but because I am no longer experiencing that financial hardship TODAY, those others get all of their interest erased, but I do not?  I am happy to pay back the $60,000 that I borrowed.  I am not so happy to pay an additional $55,000 in interest.

I hope that you will consider situations like mine when drawing up the final guidelines of this plan and that you will look at the person as a whole rather than the current snapshot of that person.  Thank you for your consideration.",,,,,,,

As a nursing student, I found that learning online was much worse than in person. It was harder for students to concentrate on online lectures, some professors could not focus well on their lectures due to many reasons such as their kids were at home too. In addition, we could not attend several clinical rotations during Covid she since school closed, and many hospitals refused to take nursing student at that time. Yet tuition fees were increased every year even during Covid. They affected the competence of new graduate nurse. I think that students who had their education being moved online during Covid should receive student debt relief, at least for the tuition fee or part of it during the two years of COVID.

This could involve forgiving a portion of the debt or providing a pathway to full forgiveness through income-driven repayment plans tied to future earnings. Additionally, providing support services such as job training, housing assistance, and mental health services could help these individuals get back on their feet and improve their financial stability.

For those who have consistently paid off their loans and have good-paying jobs, the government could offer incentives such as tax deductions or credits, loan refinancing options at lower interest rates, or employer contribution programs to recognize their efforts and reduce their remaining debt burden.

Similarly, for individuals who have consistently paid but have low to mid-paying jobs, the government could offer similar incentives and support to help them manage their debt more effectively and alleviate financial stress.""

This approach aims to provide targeted solutions for each group based on their specific needs and circumstances, helping to address the challenges they face in managing student loan debt.

But the program has been failing, as it is riddled with flaws and needless bureaucratic hurdles. Due to a combination of poor implementation and poor interpretation of program guidelines, many workers struggle to get their loans forgiven. The system is confusing, and many borrowers have made years of payments only to find these payments didn’t qualify for forgiveness.

This is unacceptable. Our government made a promise to public service workers to help them, and we cannot let them down.

I hope this goes through. There are so many impact by the ever-changing student loan program.  so many victims of this program is unacceptable and personally in someone that is impacted.  I have been impacted in many ways, whether it be the loose laws that are currently in place regarding around the governance and regulating student loans, both public and private   

Then when you get into the everyday family life where in certain cases parents take out student loans specifically the FFEL William D Ford and FEL federal Perkins loan types.  This program has clearly been taken advantage of and is inundated with loopholes   One specific loophole is parents taking student loans out for their children when they are sophomores and juniors in high school, applying for these Specific loans which are high interest, zero flexibility, and aggressive towards the customer.  One of the big loopholes in this is parents that go through a divorce have the ability to add line items in their divorce agreement Saying that they refused to pay any education costs, which then leaves the responsibility on the student Due to the parents being divorced, and having a legal document that states That one parent or both parents are not responsible for the student loan monies, interest, balance, and any other payments passed or future.  

The two scenarios I just mentioned are extremely common and take many borrowers and students alike by surprise.   by the time a student even knows that loan exist it is because a letter is being sent to them in their name now requesting money or that that loan has been transferred to another private lender which continues to happen every six months or more.  


I find some of these loan programs to be confusing intentionally.   I don’t understand why these would be even offered?  Students who are in their junior year of high school do not know how to navigate this complex system let alone a subject matter expert.   All of these loans should be discharged regardless of the reason because these students, including myself have been misled or taken advantage of due to the deregulation and loose stance that has been taken by the student loan programs offered by the federal government For decades and has only gotten worse.


it’s nice to see you that there is something here that can help.  The new changes are very encouraging however it is very upsetting to receive a forgiveness letter of $20,000 and then see those monies actually from your student loan account. Make you think that you have relief.   Next thing you know a Supreme Court finds that there’s legal standing?   This is ridiculous and we really need help and I am glad that this program is being rolled out   let’s hope that these various red states don’t block this one with their buddies from college who own a student lender and Sue based on false pretenses.  by the way, how can a student aid lender, and the state both have legal standing?    it was my impression and based on my studies in legal, how is a taxpayer impacted by a private student loan company suing because they don’t like the fact that there is a executive order to provide forgiveness to millions of Americans that desperately needed and have been bogged down by student debt for decades concurrently trying to navigate ever changing, Upsetting, and distressing on the mind for all these barrowera who are victims of this rigged system.

I hope this is final because I along with millions of other student loan holders are beyond confused about what we should be doing.  Every time we pick up the phone and make a decision we restart our clock on the loan itself or consolidation .  Thank you for addressing this, and thank you for taking the time to read this.  I know it is not a topic that is easy to discuss.  we need help and I’m glad to see that you are trying to provide it.   And I’ll say this enclosing, whatever money is forgiven, is money that will be put back into the American economy. It’s money that will put food in the families mouth. And it’s money that American should have on hand in case of an emergency, yet instead us young Americans are living in fear of  our paychecks being garnished because the student loans system is going through an overhaul and so difficult to navigate.  Please implement this Continue your pursuit on offering forgiveness on student loans as much as possible.  Many of us borrowers were misled into these loans in ways that are not accounted for.   There is a reason why all these loans originate in certain states and all have a PO Box as an address.   Loopholes were taken advantage of from the beginning.

From a former Public School Teacher (rush writing):
Statute: Section 432(a) of the HEA (20 U.S.C. 1082(a) provides that in the performance of, and with
respect to, the functions, powers, and duties, vested in him by this part, the Secretary (Sec) may enforce, ""pay"", compromise, waive, or release any right, title, claim, lien, or demand, however acquired, including any equity or any right of redemption.
I hereby give this negotiated portion of my student loan to the office of the Sec of the Department (Dept) of Education, in writing, in the amount of $3,265.34 for the three (3) years that I worked in public service, as a teacher of record, full-time, and paid on my loans, to be paid in full by June 1, 2024, avoiding election changes in administration (admin), and any personnel changes to the office of the Sec of the Dept of Education, to “pay” according to 20 USC 1082(a)(6), “however acquired.”
I have an email confirmation from noreply@debtrelief.studentaid.gov dated 10/21/22 at 11:59 AM and a print out of OMB # 1845-0110 (TEPSLF?) complete with my 3 years of public service from 2008-2011 in Cedar Hill ISD; yet, I did not receive any relief. 
This giving of $3,265.34 into the acquirement of the office of the Sec of the Dept of Education to ""pay"" shall hereby be recognized as Public Service Loan Forgiveness ""You Paid"" Pay. My loan servicer is listed in studentaid.gov as American Education Services:15 payments in 2008 and 2009 equaling $747; 12 payments in 2010 equaling $958.10; 12 payments in 2011 equaling $1,560.24, for a grand total of $3,265.34. I am at risk of defaulting on my loans before the 2024 U.S. Presidential election.
Furthermore, I hereby give all similar due loan portions to the office of the Sec to be acquired and paid under Public Service Loan Forgiveness ""You Paid"" Pay, to be paid in full by June 1, 2024, using the same statute.   
Regarding, bullet point “1” of the proposal, gainful employment, and school closures, I hereby, gift all relevant student loans to the office of the Dept of Education to be acquired ""however acquired"", as written in law, to be paid in the amount of $4,000 and to be paid before June 1, 2024 using a one-time ""Student Loan Stamp Pay"", a payment only redeemable toward the reduction of an outstanding student loan, during this negotiated rule-making process.
Perhaps, this will avoid concerns for those that are skeptical about changes to elected officials, govt delays in rule-making processes, concerns about the number of student loans serviced by one entity, namely, the govt when a similar picture already exists with the IRS and it has been noted recently as having its own problems and needing assistance in money, oversight, and tech vulnerabilities.
I ask the Dept of Education to provide the public with a current number of those accounts, applicable that have been transferred by way of this new proposal to the Dept of Education and are currently in studentaid.gov as correct and ready to be forgiven through this proposal (as my information in studentaid.gov is questionable). Please consider other borrowers whose studentaid.gov dashboards are currently incorrect. If the Secretary refuses to pay, as aforementioned, I am also asking the office of the Sec of the Dept of Education to considering extending the April 30, 2024 deadline to apply for Federal Direct Loan Consol until after all final rules, legal disputes, and congressional review are complete; yet, knowing rule-making is an on-going process, what negotiation has taken place?  This negotiated rule-making process, which was not taught in my school, for reading the federal register posting, writing my comments, researching United States Code, and rule-making process has taken considerable amount of time, at least more than 2 hours. Unfortunately, reading the proposed rule-making, rule-making process, commenting, and following mainstream media and news updates regarding legal challenges and changes does require a certain amount of time and when time is designated for following this process it takes focus from other areas of a person's life.  I don't think this proposal is the best way to relief or a relief to students given the comments from the Supreme Court about ""adding"" language the last time a proposal was offered, political uncertainty, nearby deadline to possible changes in Secretary authority, and weighing the authority of the office of the Secretary of the Dept of Education to propose a process that would take so much time, and involve so many potential obstacles to achievement, including: final rule review under the Congressional Review Act?, review from the Government Accountability Office?, enforcing issues?, a review request from anyone in the public?,  the fact that the Department of Education, itself, can also later decide to revoke any final rules. Thank you.

I was a college student in the 1990s, and took out loans to help pay for college while working full time. Minimum wage did not fully cover my in state tuition which was less than $4000, minimum wage was $4.25. I went back to school in the 2010s, again a state school, and my tuition was $15000/year.  Minimum wage was $8.00/hour. Minimum wage did not even go up two times, but tuition went up more than 3.5 times. I continued to pay on my loans. Then I went to a state graduate school, tuition was about $50,000. Working full time, I minimized my student loans, but still graduated borrowing about $166,000. The only way to go to graduate school without being from a very wealthy family would be to take student loans out. My interest rates and consolidation at graduation put my loans at $289,000. They continued to grow despite making payments of $900 per month because of the high interest rate and how much interest was capitalized. Unless the public only wants doctors and veterinarians who came from very wealthy families, they would be in favor of these programs, eliminating interest and capping the years students have to pay (as agreed in the original loan documentation). 
When I looked through my payment records, I have been paying for more than 25 years. Even if I do not qualify for forgiveness, I support these rules because they make sense to try and fix a broken system. My current loan servicer has no records of my previous payments, and cannot tell me how many years I have left to go since my consolidation loan was first taken out. When I called the Department of Education Student Aid, they also had no way to determine how long I have been paying or how long I have left to pay. They did not keep the records, I did. But does one have to prove they paid their mortgage for 30 years to get the deed? Why should we have to dig through bank statements 30 years ago to prove how long we have been in repayment, when the IBR/ICR/IDR plans came about, they all had limits on how long you would pay. This is just fixing the system that did not correctly record data. 
I am hoping next up will limit tuition costs to inflation/minimum wage for all schools, private and state schools. ",,,,,,,

I wish to express my total objection to the student debt relief program. It is completely unfair to those students who went to college in years past ( my sons and daughter in law) and while it was at times a hardship upon their families they did eventually repay the loan. Your new program mentions the current high cost of higher education. Salaries have also increased significantly, $20 per hour for fast food workers for example. Most importantly I object to the loan forgiveness program because of the life lesson it teaches. The lesson of “ I am not resonsible” whether I signed for the loan or gave my word to repay the loan. Maybe it is just to easy to obtain a student loan. Maybe not all students are college material. Possibly tech schools or the military would financially be better options for a lot of student age people. How many art majors, history teachers, basket weavers, does the world need? I was in the USAF for 5 years, went to college on the G 
I bill, worked on weekends, holidays and summers to provide for my family of 4. There was no talk of giving us anything, it was earned. Most adults recognize that when something has been worked for it is appreciated. When merely given to you its value is significantly lessened.

“Borrowers with very high balances tend to have higher incomes than do lower-balance borrowers. That may be because many higher-balance borrowers accumulated some or most of their debt from graduate school, and among college-educated individuals, those with a graduate degree generally have higher wages than those with only an undergraduate credential or without any credential at all. (21) A higher earning borrower may not only have a greater ability to pay off their debt in full in a reasonable period, there is also a greater likelihood that they may be on an earnings trajectory in which their initial earnings start out lower and then increase over time.”
I took on greater debt going to college due to being afflicted with a disability. My ADHD was and is accompanied with persistent anxiety, sleep, and emotional disorders. I graduated from High School in 2002. My biology had poor tolerance for the ADHD treatments of that time. The resulting complications made going to college difficult. Either chemically inducing anxiety attacks in the case of methylphenidates or aggression in the case of dextroamphetamines. The medication which I take now did not exist until 2007 and I was not prescribed it until much later. Due to the emotional strain, there were sections of time I opted to not take medication for my own sense of sanity. 
The disability in question rendered it impractical for me to take on additional tasks to reduce debt while in college, and I will never be fit to take on a managerial role in a professional environment. My ability to concentrate effectively is restricted to the duration of a stimulant medication. These medicines must wear off to allow for sleep and it is impractical for me to earn an income without them. Regardless, I required the higher income of a computer science degree to pay for continuing treatment of my condition and to free my family from the financial burden of caring for me. If we are to apply generalized reasoning as in the above paragraph, then it is also generally accepted that the disabled earn 37% less than their non-disabled peers due to the limitations imposed by their disabilities. Therefore, aid should not be limited to the disabled or otherwise infirm purely on the reasoning provided under section 30.82. 

I would argue that any individual with a disability, confirmed by the testimony of his physician, that also shows significant delay or inconsistencies in gainful employment as per IRS tax documentation and date of birth, should qualify for the $20,000 in loan forgiveness bear minimum. A disabled individual who does not have a consistent yearly income until his 30's should qualify as that already comes with a significant deficit in savings towards housing, retirement, vehicles, etc. ","Federal Agency",,,,,,

So many students went to college and pursued stem fields hoping to grow their economic opportunities, give back to their country as educated trained professionals, and have both intended and tried (are trying) to pay their loans back. Education was supposed to be the surest tool for economic mobility. Funding for education has been cut, educational grants have been cut, tuition costs have reason astronomically. I’m curious if opponents to this proposal, who don’t support loan forgiveness, would have rather had a generation of quitters, because that for most of us was the only other option to working hard, pushing through, studying hard, and entering the job market. Now largely because of student loans many of us struggle to be able to buy a vehicle (not even a new one), home ownership seems like an impossibility, and our purchasing power to help drive GDP or start a new business is limited or completely out of reach. This proposal is not designed to help rich kids who never had to work for anything nor is it designed to reward lazy freeloaders who don’t want to work. This is about helping the middle class plain and simple. If we want to “put America first,” we need to understand that this proposal is akin to pandemic related PPP loan forgiveness as part of the American Rescue plan. No one who received loan forgiveness through that plan has a leg to stand on opposing this plan. It NEEDS to happen, and I am thankful the administration is taking this issue seriously.",,,,,,,

It’s been broken for decades. Forgiveness is an important element to counteract the hideous behavior of the loan servicers steering borrowers into the wrong plans to make money. The universities and colleges that’s kept charging higher tuition every year since the 1980’s are not blameless. They knew that they could talk naive 18 year old students into getting loans to pay their ever inflationary tuition. The interest rate charged for these loans is ridiculous and shouldn’t be anything ever above 1%. Transparency about your loans was absent especially after you went into repayment and your loan was sold off. Mine was  multiple times sold to make money on them. One bank that owned them doesn’t exist anymore after the 2008 crisis! 
      They never told me about idr plans ever, I was always just steered into forbearance or deferment. I owe more than I took out by double because I consolidated my loans twice. How is that even allowed? You get better terms from a crappy payday loan because at least it is transparent. Another problem is the people in this country who are against forgiveness or loan reform. They think it’s handout and compare it mortgages and car loans. They say ignorant comments about “Pay your loan tax payers should not have to pay… maybe the government should pay off my car loan or mortgage..” what they fail to understand is you were supposed to pay for a certain amount of time and be done. I’ve been in repayment since 2000. Still paying. I’ve owned a house and when we paid eventually the balance went down. The student loans have not done that for millions of borrowers including myself . So, NO, loan forgiveness is not a handout,  it’s to fix a broken system that made money off people’s dream and right to an education.  ",,,,,,,

My coursework has underscored the importance of transparent budgeting practices and responsible allocation of public resources. Therefore, I am particularly concerned about the potential financial implications of the proposed rule for student loan debt relief. Evaluating the budgetary impact, identifying funding sources, and ensuring sustainability are fundamental aspects of public administration, and I believe these considerations are paramount in the context of debt relief measures. Therefore, I urge the regulatory agency to develop a comprehensive payment plan that addresses these concerns and provides clarity on how the costs of debt relief will be financed.
A study by Catherine and Yannelis (2023) highlighted the distributional effects of student loan forgiveness, emphasizing the need to consider equity and fairness in distributing the costs and benefits of debt relief measures, especially considering the impact on low-income households. Similarly, the implementation of performance-based budgeting in the public sector, as discussed by Surianti and Dalimunthe (2015), underscores the importance of comprehensive planning and evaluation in public sector initiatives, which supports the argument for the need to develop a comprehensive plan for funding and implementing debt relief measures.
By incorporating insights from these scholarly sources, we can ensure that debt relief efforts are sustainable, equitable, and accountable to the public.

Our son graduated from High School in 2010, wanted the college experience and applied and received financial assistance.  We discussed with him the obligation that he would have to repay that loan after graduation. Our son went on to graduate school, got married within 24 months. His wife also had loans that required repayment.  They both took on extra work for added income with the focus on getting out of debt.  They chose to go without cable television, they didn't go out to eat, they opted to forgo entertainment (movies) etc.  Within 4 years after graduation, they were debt free. Our son knew when he signed the loan paperwork, taking on debt was his obligation and was it was a decision that he took total responsibility for.  

Every student that has a loan made a decision to go into debt.  Debt is a responsibility that requires repayment.  Why should taxpayers have to accept the responsibility of debt for individuals that will earn far more money if their lifetimes as college graduates versus general laborers?

The interests are extremely too high to the point that one may not feel like they are making any progress on paying off the debt. The monthly payments are too high even with the income based programs. The student loan debt has become a real problem when trying to make life decisions like purchasing a home, choosing between medical bills vs. student loan payments. The way college education was sold to everyone about being the only way to succeed and people following that recommended path, interest shouldn't be applied or should be a cap on the interest, the interest should always be less than 2%, student loans shouldn't be seen on credit reports or reflected on credit scores, there needs to be a solution to help people actually pay off the debt instead of just paying interest and never make progress in the balance, educational grants should be much higher so students don't have to look to loans to pay for education, there needs to be a debt relief program for everyone within 10 years or less of making payments not just for public workers because we are all contributing to society by working and paying taxes.

Further, regardless of the year the loan was taken, it would make a big difference in people's lives if the debt would be relieved for everyone within a certain income bracket to debt ratio. Debt relief should be applied if under an income driven plan and the calculations show that no significant progress will be made to the debt within 5 to 10 years.","Four-Year Public Institution of Higher Education",,,,,,

Pursuing a college education for many is the only thing we can do to try and ‘break the cycle’ of poverty. Except, with the cost of education so high, it pushed many of my peers to factories, retail, etc. all due to the fact that they didn’t qualify for government assistance but couldn’t afford the day-to-day cost of education.

Hello my name is Norma C.,and I want to thank you for this opportunity to leave a comment. In the year 2020 I took it apon myself to go back to school. I enrolled into Grand Rapids Community College in hopes of earning my associates degree along with a bachelor's degree to become a social worker. I was very worried and nervous because it had been a long time since I was in school. I was worried that I wouldn't be able achieve my goal to be a social worker. See I love to care and help people in need. I worked very hard to pass my first semester and I was all set up to go for my second semester. Then covid-19 hit and the world stood still for a lot of scared people. My son Remington got sent home when everyone went to remote learning. It was quite difficult to navigate that whole system times two. The stress had gotten so bad that my mental health suffered and I ended up in the hospital unable to finish my schooling. I had to put my studies on hold indefinitely. I was very crushed and now I'm left with this dept hanging over my head. I am asking and pleasing for Biden to fulfill his promises to cancel student debt. I'm a single mother trying to make ends meet and can't afford the amount I owe. I hope this reaches somebody that can help me with this burden. That's all I have to say. 
Thanks again, Norma C.","Other",,,,,,

My name is Quinn Feeney, and I wanted to thank you for the work that you do to make college more affordable. I am writing in support of this rule change that would expand loan forgiveness and make the system clearer. As a college student, graduating this year, I have spoken with many close friends about anxieties around not only high student loan debt but also the confusion around the system as a whole. High student debt appears to harm the economy. As student debt-to-income ratios rise by 1%, consumption decreases by almost 4%. This also has serious equity implications, as black students tend to have approximately $25,000 more in debt compared to white students. Additionally, complicated processes also make it more challenging for individuals to access benefits. For these reasons, I find it imperative that this rule to expand and make clearer student loan forgiveness is pursued by the Department of Education.

Thank you,
Quinn Feeney

The career path of some post-grad borrowers entails years of working for little pay in a series of practicum, internship, and post-doctoral residency toward a license to practice what their graduate studies were aimed toward. This is especially true for mental health providers. Life circumstances may extend the time a borrower may need to complete the long process of earning a license and gaining an income in alignment with their hard-earned credentials. It may be a borrower significantly advances in age, years of earning potential significantly reduced. An elder is left with huge debt and limited potential of paying, especially if bloated with accrued and capitalized interest. An elder who has worked for years at training sites for little pay may have no savings or retirement benefits to rely on for old age. Student loan repayments are calculated on current and projected income. An elder in such a situation, who may have finally achieved one or two years of increased income is faced with the pressure to work longer than they may be able to work, due to aging, not medical disability. Such an elder may be faced with huge student loan payments, which preclude saving for their own care in their advancing years. This is an overlooked group of senior citizens for whom the current loan repayment system constitutes agism. Personal experience demonstrates these challenges. Like many women in America, in my fifties, life circumstances required me to develop a career and become financially independent. I first received direct loans when I began my doctoral program in 2009. Due to the long steps toward being able to use my Ph.D. for income, and the need to provide support to my adult son during years of severe mental illness, multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, and months of re-stabilization, I was only able to complete my post-doctoral residency in 2021. I have been slowly developing a private practice, and my income has increased, but I have no savings. Due to the need to move from one low-paying agency to the next, I have no significant retirement fund. Now I struggle to work as many hours as I can, but at 73 I wonder how long I can keep up. My loans were over $250,000.00, partly due to capitalized interest when I changed to a lower repayment plan and applied for loan consolidation. Rather than putting every dollar I can into preparing for the years ahead, I have put every dollar into repaying my loans, which I have paid down to $136,000.00 so far. I am determined to keep paying on my student loans, but every day I worry about how long I can work and about my future with no savings. I still am not a licensed psychologist, which has always been my goal. My work load, decreasing energy and other natural consequences of aging, have been a deterrent to preparing for the rigorous licensing exams. I work under my license as a Marriage and Family Therapist, which I obtained along the way go earning my doctorate. During my years of training to become a psychologist that license was of no help to me. I considered going into Public Service with that license to help earn loan forgiveness, and my license as an MFT would qualify me to apply for a Public Service position. However, the Public Service system will not allow loans for one degree to be forgiven while working under another license. This too is an issue I hope President Biden's plan will address. One last issue is that borrowers who earn Doctoral degrees in non-APA approved Clinical Psychology programs, which qualify to disburse federal Grad Plus loans and that meet rigorous criteria for licensure as a Psychologist, are discriminated against in opportunity to gain loan forgiveness by working in federal government agencies or Public Service. This is discrimination against some borrowers, who chose non-APA programs like mine, which offer a rigorous, licensure-qualified, but more broad, diverse study of Psychology than the narrow APA dictated study of Psychology. This also highlights a Federal Graduate Student Loan program collusion with APA's monopoly in dictating parameters of the study of Psychology and of the training and employment opportunities of those who wish to serve their communities as licensed Psychologists. In effect APA is dictating elitism, which is contrary to the values of diversity in thought and in opportunity. I hope that President Biden's comprehensive restructuring of the Federal Student Loan program will seriously consider that this monopoly is limiting the availability of excellent mental health providers to a nation in short supply of such providers.

While we appreciate the efforts to ""forgive"" student loan debt, we are not able to see how to actually apply and receive ""forgiveness.""

Our daughter's school put her loan under her father's name.  She either did not make enough to pay or was raising children and not working so we have been paying her FFELP Consolidated loan with Navient since 2007. (17 years)

We have paid back well over what was borrowed along with substantial interest, however, still have a balance of roughly $17,000 and another six years before it's paid off.

I have searched and searched and read and read articles, the studentaid.gov website, the Navient website etc, and cannot really decipher exactly what needs to be done to apply.  Each site keeps referring back to another site, mentions numerous programs and conditions and requirements and terms to qualify, such that it is confusing and not clear how to obtain ""forgiveness.""

There is also substantial resistance by the public and courts to allow ""forgiveness"" the way the Biden Admin is trying.

There is too much confusion and too many conditions to make it easy for borrowers to apply for ""forgiveness."" 

Why do you not come up with a simple plan, for example, drop the interest rates to 0% for anyone who has been paying for over 10 years on all loans with all lenders?

That way borrowers could make headway towards their balances, the lenders will have received their interest back, and the public does not feel like they have to ""pay someone else's loans.""

Please come up with a clear, concise, do-able way that the public and courts will not object to and that is easy and do-able for the borrowers.  It is very stressful to keep seeing artilces about loan forgiveness but after going around in circles on the government and lender's websites, not be able to see how to obtain the ""forgiveness.""

Thank you.

Those loans that were consolidate would show a zero balance but the new Consolidated loan would show the combined balance but be after the cut off date.  

So if a person had a 2 loans in repayment January 1 2005, then they consolidated and that consolidated loan entered repayment in July 10 2005  they may not be considered for forgiveness even though they were for loans in repayment prior to July 1, 2005.  
Just seems like a technical issue that could arise.

*Summary*
1. Even though the original loans being consolidated were in repayment before July 1, 2005, the new consolidated loan's repayment started after this date.
2. This timing mismatch could potentially lead to these loans not being considered for forgiveness under the specified criteria.
3. Despite being originally eligible, the technicality of consolidation and repayment start date might disqualify them from forgiveness.

Spending hundreds of billions of dollars that this country does not have to cancel student loan debt, including borrowers with healthy incomes and able to repay it, is a reckless financial decision that endangers the countrys future. Indeed, a study from the Penn Wharton has estimated that 750,000 debtors with average annual household incomes of nearly $313,000 will benefit from the administrations proposed rule. The explosion in the national debt is fueling inflation and making it harder for Americans to buy groceries and fill their gas tanks. Our children and grandchildren will be forced to pay higher taxes for years to come to settle the debts, voluntarily taken by our fellow citizens, that the current administration now hopes to foist on the public.

I am writing to share my personal story and urge for your support in advocating my student loan forgiveness. As a parent striving to provide a better future for my children, the burden of student debt weighs heavily on our family's ability to invest in their education and well-being.  I currently have a daughter in her inaugural year of college, focusing on Physical Therapy, with plans to pursue graduate studies afterward. Additionally, another child has recently completed cosmetology training and is residing with us at home. Lastly, we have a seven-year-old who is currently in first grade.
Like countless others, I pursued higher education with the hope of securing a brighter future for myself and my family. However, the reality of student loan debt has become a significant obstacle, hindering our financial stability, and limiting our ability to support our children's educational journey.
As our kids embark on their own academic paths, the prospect of shouldering both their future tuition expenses and our existing student loan obligations is daunting. We want nothing more than to provide them with the opportunities we've worked so hard to attain, but the weight of student debt casts a shadow of uncertainty over their prospects.
Forgiving student loans isn't just about alleviating individual financial burdens—it's about investing in the future of our children and generations to come. By lifting the weight of student debt from my family, I can redirect resources towards our children's education, enrichment activities, and essential needs, ensuring they have the tools and support necessary to succeed.
Moreover, student loan forgiveness isn't just an economic issue; it's a moral imperative. It's about recognizing the systemic barriers to education and economic mobility that disproportionately impact marginalized communities and working-class families. By forgiving my student loans, I can begin to dismantle these barriers and create a more equitable society where everyone has a fair chance to thrive.
I urge you to consider the transformative impact of student loan forgiveness on families like mine and the broader societal benefits it entails.
Thank you for your attention to this critical issue, and I look forward to your support in advocating for meaningful action on student loan forgiveness.
Sincerely, 
Lloyd Sanderson

I am a Masters of Public Policy student at the University of Virginia deeply interested and invested in expanding equality and opportunity in education. Let me first briefly describe my background and where I am coming from in forming my opinion on this very controversial and provoking issue. In reading through much of the popular ire on the issue of student loan forgiveness programs, many of the arguments are based on ‘paying for someone else’s poor decisions’ and that people knew what they were getting themselves into by taking out loans and should be responsible for paying it back on their own. 

I myself was determined to not take out any student loans and chose to attend a comparatively lower ranked, public university rather than pay tens of thousands of dollars at a high ranked private institution. To get myself through school I applied to and received several scholarships and worked multiple jobs throughout my time at UVA and during the summers including: tutoring, TAing, and research. With this effort and decisions I am graduating this spring with my Masters in Public Policy and graduated last year with a degree in Economics and Foreign Affairs completely debt free. Integral in accomplishing this, however, was my privilege. I am privileged to be at a supportive institution like UVA which has a lot of well compensated opportunities for employment, to have access to scholarships to apply to, a stable home environment where I do not need to contribute to or support my family’s income, to have gone to a high ranked public high school that gave me an education that allows me to perform well in school and qualify for tutoring work, and much more. This is not the case and situation for everyone attending college and with the continuously skyrocketing prices of even public institutions and unprecedented student loan levels placing significant burden on the 43 million Americans struggling with seemingly insurmountable student loan debt. 

The strength of this legislation is its specificity, in that it is not a simple blanket loan forgiveness program but considers income, occupation, age, and more in amounts of funds for these different groups. While I am generally supportive of this policy, one concern I have is about the allocation of a significant amount of limited government resources towards student loan forgiveness. A Brookings study argued that the government must “weigh student-loan forgiveness against other spending priorities and be clear about what we value most” and to place the amount the program would cost into context compared it to other government assistance programs. For example, $10,000 blanket forgiveness to the 43 million Americans would be larger than the amount spent on welfare (TANF) since 2000, the cost of subsidized or free school lunch programs, and more. Legislators should carefully weigh the costs of this program and whether student loan forgiveness is of higher priority than other social assistance programs. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

The surge in student debt is driven by rising college tuition costs contrasted with declines in state education funding and financial aid availability. These problems are exacerbated by predatory practices of for-profit institutions targeting students of color. Deceptive practices by loan servicers and the mishandling of loan forgiveness programs by this agency underscores the need for action to relieve borrowers dealing with the consequences of a flawed system.

Student loan forgiveness alleviates financial strains on individuals, stimulates consumer spending, and fosters greater socioeconomic mobility. More than half of all student borrowers note that their entire financial stability depends on loan forgiveness (Lucas et al., 2023). With the removal of debt, student borrowers can purchase a home, settle other financial obligations like credit card debts, and rely less on social safety nets. Studies indicate that debt cancellation would increase GDP by billions of dollars and create up to 1.5 million new jobs, decreasing the unemployment rate (Fullwiler, 2018). The reduction of educational debt not only enhances mental well-being but enables families to put more into savings (Barnes, 2022).

Student debt forgiveness has the potential to reduce inequity by providing relief to those disproportionately affected by student debt, such as low-income and minority communities.  Women have over two-thirds of all outstanding student loan debt (Banerjee & Garcia, 2020). Black women have an average of $38,800 in federal loans after completing their undergraduate education, surpassing other demographic groups (Jackson & Williams, 2022). On average, Black borrowers still owe 95% of their debt after 20 years, in contrast to white borrowers who owe only 5% of their debt over the same period (IASP, 2019). 

Debt relief will have lasting effects across generations by enabling families to build wealth and provide financial support for their relatives to pursue and complete their higher education degrees (Lucas et al., 2023). Reducing student debt has the potential to narrow the racial wealth divide, with research indicating that forgiving $50,000 in student debt would relieve the financial strain for approximately three-quarters of Black households and boost Black wealth by one-third (Smith, 2020). 

The Department of Education’s proposed rule on expanding student loan forgiveness represents a significant effort to address the escalating crisis of student debt in the United States. By acknowledging the complexities of the issue, including predatory practices, disparities in debt burden among demographic groups, and the far-reaching implications on socioeconomic mobility, the proposed rule offers hope for millions of borrowers burdened by financial strain. The effects of debt relief extend beyond individual borrowers to impact entire communities and future generations, promising a more equitable and inclusive higher education system.

I am very hopeful about the Administration's efforts to help with Student Debt Relief. I wanted to share my story. As a first-generation American, it was a foregone conclusion that I would go to college after high school. But, my dad worked as a taxi driver throughout my childhood and my mom was a paralegal. They provided me with everything I needed but could not pay for my college. I chose to go out of state in the hopes of getting a quality education — thinking that was best at the time. Without parents who had gone through the experience or siblings guiding the way, I had to forge my path and make decisions at 18 that I may not have fully comprehended. I took out loans for all four years of my undergraduate education, including money to pay for food, housing, and books. 

Upon graduating, I enrolled in law school — in the hopes of furthering my education and becoming a successful lawyer. I was young and naive and took out more student debt, but this time it was significantly more. Yet, I thought upon graduating from law school, I'd get a big-time lawyer job and pay it all off relatively quickly. Unfortunately, my grandmother passed the summer before my second year of law school and she and I were incredibly close — it shook me to my core. As a result, my second-year grades suffered — and my first-year grades were not great to begin with. I ended up not returning my third year because the school informed me I was not doing well enough to continue. So I had to find a new path. 

That was in 2013. Since then, I have changed careers and had a stable job for a few years until the middle of the pandemic when I lost my full-time job in media. Currently, I am unemployed and have over $200,000 in student loans. I don't see a future where I would be making a salary that would be significant enough to pay that back. 

I am asking — begging — for the administration to ensure that my entire debt is forgiven. Please! If there is any information I can provide, I'd be happy to do so. I simply want to feel like I can potentially purchase a home or buy a car in the future once I do get a full-time job again. ","Individual",,,,,,

As a taxpayer, I oppose the federal government’s unconstitutional plan to transfer the cost of others’ student loan debt onto me and every other American while our wallets continue to be drained by inflation. Now is not the time to force me to pay for someone else's financial decisions.

This regulation is not legal. The Supreme Court already rejected the original debt transfer plan under the HEROES Act. In part, the decision reaffirmed Congress’ sole authority to take such drastic action. 

To me, this seems like nothing more than an election year scheme to bribe voters with the promise of free money—but it won’t work. I’m tired of this administration’s inflation-fueling agenda and complete disregard for the law and taxpayers.

I worked and paid off my student loans! No one is forcing these people to go to school and take out student loans. The keyword here is LOANS! They BORROWED the money! They knew when they borrowed it That it was to be paid back! STOP this pandering just to receive votes from the greedy weak minded!

Not only will this proposal ultimately cause individuals who did not seek higher education to help pay back this forgiveness though taxes, but those who atleast had the forthought to seek an education of value that would allow them to pay back what was promised, will also be asked to pay through taxes.

The forgiven party would be absolved of the debts they owe due to their inability to seek an education of valve.

The responsibile party that never borrowed money for higher education will be forced to help pay back the this debt through taxes.

The responsibile party that borrowed money for an education that would allow them to pay back the mo ey they barrowed will still be responsible to pay back their loans as well as be forced to pay back the debt throught taxes.

In my opinion the only way this proposal should be accepted is if those who do not receive forgiveness can receive a taxes exemption from the cost incurred to forgive these loans and those who are forgiven will have their income taxes increase by an equal percentage to cover the cost for 5-10 years or requirethat those forgiven have to go through the process of filling bankruptcy and having their luxuryassets liquidated. If not this section should be removed from the proposal entirely. My neighbor should not be held responsible just because I borrowed money that I couldn't afford to pay back. 

Also, wouldn't this rule be more effective if institutions were fined and banned from offering these fields of education if it can be proven that they do not lead to gainful employment? Wouldn't negligence be assumed given that their is data to support the forgiveness and if the data has been avaliable long enough to prove negligence than shouldn't the schools who offered the program as what would be an egregious cost be held partially if not fully responsible for the reimbursement instead of the people???",,,,,,,

The entire student loan system has been set up to benefit the government and banks. We spent decades telling young people to get a college degree no matter the cost because it was the only way to guarantee a middle class life. Student loans have turned the American Dream into a Nightmare.  

When I married my wife at 25 years old she had student loan debt that ballooned to $315,000. She is not a doctor or a lawyer, but a psychologist. When we got married we committed to paying off her loan. We have been responsible in paying back the loan but because of interest we have gotten nowhere.  
We sacrifice and pay more than the minimum payment but the loan does not move due to interest.  During the first 4 years of repayment, we paid $40,000 into the loan only for the principle to be reduced by $8,000.  We have been responsible and continued to pay on the loan even during the COVID pause on payments.  It should not take a global pandemic to make progress on your loan.  The issue of forgiveness is not that people do not want to pay their loans.  With the added interest, people have repaid their loans multiple times over. We need help with interest which makes it impossible to pay off.  Why is the American Higher Education system built on making college so unaffordable that we saddle 20-year olds with six-figure debt that they spend the rest of their lives repaying?  People have to delay starting families and purchasing homes to service astronomical debt. Then add having  children and the cost of daycare, so that you can go to work to pay off the debt that you took out to get a job in the first place and the middle class is tapped out. This is all heading to a retirement crisis for my generation as every dollar not being saved for retirement is going to student loans.

Even the way the monthly payment is calculated is set up to disadvantage married couples where one person has a loan.  My wife does not make much money and I have carried the house for much of our marriage as the sole breadwinner.  However because we file our taxes jointly, my income is used to calculate her repayment which makes the minimum monthly payment go significantly higher. To add insult to injury, while I work for an entity that is eligible for Public Student Loan Forgiveness, she does not. I have worked in public service more than a decade. Her loan cannot be forgiven even though it is MY income that is used to calculate the payment, and my income that is used to pay it. If the loan were in my name it could have been forgiven.  The benefits of the student loan forgiveness should be extended to the HOUSEHOLD. A married couple filing jointly is in it together and in most cases the debt burdens both spouses.

I am a responsible, middle-class taxpayer. My tax dollars go to support EVERYONE else: low income families, illegal aliens, tax breaks for billionaires, wars, and nation-building in other countries. They are never used to benefit me.  I implore you, please provide forgiveness on the astronomical interest that accrues making these loans impossible to pay back.  We have sacrificed our entire adult lives. Reduce the interest rate and forgive remaining debts for people whose loans have doubled and tripled after they have taken them out.

I will suggest that the university benefiting from these loans reimburse the federal government.

Because the federal government operates in deficit, the money that was distributed to students was borrowed by the US Treasury, and if student loan borrowers do not repay, then taxpayers will face the costs of financing that debt, wither through higher taxes or more likely through inflation.

The debtor is unable to pay the full amount in a reasonable time, based on financial information;

The cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount.

Analysis by the Penn-Wharton Budget Model found that the 20-year debt discharge provision of the proposed rule will provide a benefit in excess of $25,000 on average to 750,000 high-income households with average incomes well above $300,000 per year.  Clearly, these borrowers and many other beneficiaries of the taxpayer largesse proposed are able to pay the full amount they owe, and there is no reason to believe collection costs would be unreasonable.

The rising costs of postsecondary education, combined with stagnant income levels, have led many students from low- and middle-income families to heavily rely on student loans to finance their education. These proposed changes would allow the Secretary to forgive debts in certain cases and waive interest, fees, or penalties on loans, including HEAL Program loans.

These regulations represent a critical step in alleviating the financial burden faced by millions of borrowers. By providing targeted debt relief, the Department can help borrowers manage their loan obligations more effectively and avoid the negative consequences of delinquency and default. I commend the Department for taking action to address the student loan debt crisis and urge them to finalize these regulations to provide much-needed relief to borrowers across the country.

You try to speak with anyone, and the hold times are outrageous, and you get a different answer each time, so how are we supposed to know what is the right way to proceed with our loans???

I have been on a Graduated plan this whole time and I pay $219/month - I have been told that if I go to the SAVE plan my payment will jump to $412!!! And in the IDR plan it will be $300-something! How is any of this helping me?! I make $84.000 before taxes - $77,000 this tax year.  Why am I being penalized?

What logic is being used to make the decisions on who is/isn't being forgiven?

Why is someone with less than $12,500 in loans having all of their debt wiped out, but someone with $13K not?! Or why not $20k, $30k, $40k? I have $40k, why isn't my debt just as equal from a forgiveness standpoint as someone with $12K? 

The economic hardship factor - that is super subjective - who decides what's a hardship?! Maybe I am struggling right now to pay all bills - housing, car, student loans, etc, but if I make some arbitrarily defined amount of money I don't qualify? But I am experiencing a hardship! What a person makes shouldn't matter; it's all relative to that individual.

The public worker forgiveness - why is that allowed? Who cares if someone has a job like that, how is their student loan debt any more special than mine? There are plenty of jobs in that ""category"" that aren't helping squat or providing any meaningful public service, but just because they have the correct job ""title"" then they are eligible for forgiveness?! How is that fair? Maybe my job is providing a helpful service in the private sector - why should public workers have favoritism?!

And again, why are we being required to figure all of this out - we are talking about serious money in some cases for people with huge impacts on their lives.  The best plan for each person should automatically be chosen and that's that.  

This is a huge debacle, similar to FAFSA - what the hell is going on?! It shouldn't be this hard and complicated and so damn confusing. ","Institutional and Loan Servicers",,,,,,
