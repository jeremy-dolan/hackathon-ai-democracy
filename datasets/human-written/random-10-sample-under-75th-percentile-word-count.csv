1274,81,I am 100% against any type of student debt relief. These kids are talked into taking classes that they cannot get jobs for or barely pay enough to live. Carrier students that never intend to get meaningful jobs just there to kill time snd get loans to party on. If these many kids have this much debt and cant get jobs to pay for the loan then the system is broke and the federal gov is promoting this kind of wrongness
1489,41,"Hello!

My name is Tiffany Tran and I have a subsidized loan back in 2020 for $4500. I would like to receive the debt relief since my amount under $20k. Is there any way I can qualify for this. 

Thank you,

Tiffany Tran"

Parents who took out Parent Plus loans for their children are not able to get any relief.  Especially for the ones where the child did receive the relief due to a fraudulent school but the parents did not. There should be some way to tie these together. "
1623,46,"please help us by cancelling student loan payment as i am currently finding it difficult to pay back my loan. this will go a long way to bring a releif in this period of economic hardship. Thanks and God bless you my president.

733,80,"Please push forward and do what is best for the American people. Each graduated and un-graduated student brings more to society and the economy than the ""average"" citizen. Loan forgiveness from trying to better the future of my family would put us in a much better standing to actually enjoy a life we all work so incredibly hard for. Thank you for your time and continuing to pursue this generational shift of bettering the world from where it currently is."
622,159,"This is absurd. Maybe it's well-meaning - I don't know. It's certainly not fair to those who have already paid off their student loans. It's not good policy, considering many of those eligible have received degrees that have little market value. Are you treating Gender Studies and Basket Weaving the same as Civil Engineering? If nothing else, you should target loan forgiveness at majors that make some sort of useful contribution to society, majors that generate economic benefits for both the person and the US in gneneral. Also, what happens to the first person who takes out a loan AFTER current loans are forgiven? Aren't they kind of left in the dust? What's the policy or law that's going to protect him/her? This is just generally not a good idea, it pays people for getting useless degrees, it costs taxpayers money other Biden Administration policies have made sure they don't have, and there is no follow-up plan. Stow this."
607,101,"For the 24 years since graduating MUSIC school, I have felt an immense pressure on my chest. My principle was always too high for my income to permit me to make a single payment. (That's what the loan company told me!) As a result, my loan has grown over $100K since graduation. ""Interest"" is a fabrication; moreover, education should be free in a free country. Please take any and all steps needful to eliminate student loan debt. Next, please create universal basic income, to honor those of us whose contributions to society are not monetary.

433,154,"I don't think there should be a student loan forgiveness program. I totally understand what this program is about and helping the economy grow. I believe people go to college to gain knowledge for the career they want knowing they will have to pay for that education.

The country is in so much debt, why forgive student loans? I know prices on everything has gone up (food, housing, gas, electricity, etc) with wages rising slightly with the annual cost of living increases. It used to be that people would live at home (with parents) longer, get a roommate or two, or work more than one job to pay for necessities. Why are people so greedy and constantly want handouts? We are a nation of me, me, me...want, want, want. Work for what you want!

Please, do not approve a student loan forgiveness program. I, as a taxpayer, do not want to fund other people's education.

938,145,"I am in full support of this measure. I have been paying my loans since I graduated in 2012 and have not made a dent. I have repaid the loan in full, but because of the interested I owe just as much as when I began paying. I am all for people paying back what they borrow, but the interest charged on these loans is unfair. I had no idea what I was agreeing to when I was 18, if I had known I most likely would not have gone to college. I was promised by so many adults that I would have no problem paying off the loan once I graduated. I am unable to do things like own a home or save for retirement due to these loans. My credit is also impacted by the amount of debt due to my student loans. "
1243,160,"I hope to get some relief from my Parent Plus Student Loan.  My loan was in default and has accrued a lot.of interest.  I originally owed around $30,000.  Now, I owe $40,000.  I took.out this loan for.my oldest daughter without truly understanding what I was getting myself into.  She attended school of the Art Institute  of Chicago. My daughter ended up dropping out of college after about 2 years and I'm stuck with the full.amount of the loan.  I never took.out a student loan for myself.  Taking out this student loan was one of the biggest financial.mistakes of my life.  It truly regret it.  I'm hoping that at the very least the interst can be cancelled.  I have to start making minimum payments of $466 a month which I really can't afford.  I think that Biden's student loan forgiveness plan would help a lot.of people.  

Sincerely,
Giovanna Dato "
