Subject: Comment on Proposed Rulemaking for Student Debt Relief

After putting in the effort to pay for my own education through a combination of service in the Army National Guard and hard work, I believe it's essential that we support the next generation by alleviating the burden of student loan debt. Forgiving student loans would not only bring relief to borrowers but also enable them to contribute positively to their communities, just as I was able to give back to New Tamaraville.

Sincerely,
Jose Blackburn"
Deborah,Chambers,Strongside,New Hampshire,"I am writing to express my strong support for the proposed regulation to forgive student loan debt. Having worked hard to put myself through community college and earning an associate's degree in early childhood education, I understand the significant burden that student loan debt can place on individuals and families. Many Americans, like myself, have taken on student loans in pursuit of higher education, only to be saddled with insurmountable debt.

Forgiving student loan debt would not only provide relief to individuals, but it would also have a positive impact on our communities and society as a whole. It would allow people to focus on building their careers, starting families, and contributing to their local economies without the weight of debt holding them back. I believe that investing in the education and well-being of our citizens is essential for building a stronger, more prosperous future for all."
Kari,Ramos,New Williambury,Arizona,"I strongly support the proposed regulation to forgive student loan debt. The drastic rise in postsecondary education costs has resulted in an unsustainable burden on low- and middle-income borrowers, forcing many to rely on Federal student loans just to secure a degree. As someone who worked hard to rise to partner at a local firm, I understand the importance of making sound financial decisions. However, I also know that our young people should not be penalized for pursuing higher education, nor should they be expected to sacrifice their long-term financial stability.

By targeting debt relief to specific circumstances, such as borrowers who have seen their loan balance grow significantly since entering repayment or those who attended institutions with high debt-to-earnings rates, this regulation addresses the root causes of the problem rather than simply symptomatically canceling debts. I firmly believe that providing a fresh start for responsible borrowers will have a far-reaching positive impact on our economy and society as a whole, ultimately benefitting all citizens."
Sharon,Allen,Deborahbury,California,"Having raised two daughters and lived through numerous economic ups and downs, I understand the struggle to make ends meet, especially for young families. Forgiving student loan debt is a compassionate solution that will bring financial freedom to those weighed down by burdensome loans, allowing them to focus on providing for their families and building stable futures. By doing so, this proposal will inject vitality into our economy and strengthen the foundations of our communities, ensuring a brighter tomorrow for all generations."
Nicole,Harris,Lake Samuelborough,Alabama,"Forgiving student loan debt would unfairly redistribute the financial burden to taxpayers, including retirees like myself who worked hard to pay for their own education and have lived within their means. This regulation would perpetuate a culture of fiscal irresponsibility and ignore the contractual obligation between borrowers and lenders."
Leslie,Hernandez,Lake Jason,Idaho,"I am concerned that forgiveing student loan debt without considering the consequences will undermine the value of education and unfairly reward certain groups at the expense of others. While it's understandable to want to alleviate financial burdens, simply waiving debt does not address the underlying issues driving up the cost of postsecondary education. Furthermore, this regulation overlooks the hard work and responsible borrowing choices made by students who have worked to pay off their loans. Instead of blanket forgiveness, I propose that we prioritize strategies aimed at increasing access to affordable education, improving college affordability, and streamlining repayment options to truly help those struggling."
Michael,Rhodes,Davidhaven,Mississippi,"I'm Michael Rhodes, a small-town musician and mechanic from Davidhaven, Mississippi. While I understand the struggles of student loan debt, I'm opposed to this proposed regulation to forgive student loan debt. In my community, I've learned the importance of hard work and taking responsibility for one's actions. Forgiving debt without fair consideration to those who have managed their finances prudently creates an unfair expectation that others will shoulder the burden. Instead of debt forgiveness, I believe in promoting affordable education options, providing clear guidance on loan repayment, and incentivizing students to borrow responsibly."
Susan,Trujillo,Port Sarah,Louisiana,"I strongly oppose the proposed regulation to forgive student loan debt. Having raised two children who worked hard to secure their own education, I believe that forgiveness sends a message that personal financial responsibility is not required. Moreover, the taxpayers of Port Sarah and this great nation should not bear the burden of forgiving loans that were incurred through individual choices.

We should promote prudence and budgeting among students instead of passing on the costs to others. The notion that our collective pocketbooks should automatically remedy every financial problem diminishes the values of hard work, planning, and self-sufficiency that are essential to individual and societal well-being. Instead, we should strive for a more responsible approach that emphasizes scholarship initiatives, income-based repayment options, and vocational training programs to better address the needs of today's students.

Sincerely,
Susan Trujillo"
Grace,Turner,South Troy,New Mexico,"Forgiving student loan debt sets a poor precedent and undermines the personal responsibility and financial prudence that I tried to instill in my own children. Instead, reforms should focus on alleviatinginterest burdens and promoting fair, income-based repayment options for those struggling to make ends meet."
Kayla,Proctor,Alexanderview,California,"I believe it is misguided to propose the forgiveness of student loan debt without addressing the broader issues surrounding higher education costs. As a librarian, I spent my career connecting students with valuable resources and guiding them toward successful futures. However, I've watched as the escalating cost of higher education has made it increasingly difficult for students to manage their finances responsibly. 

Rather than shifting the financial burden from borrowers to taxpayers, we should focus on implementing policies that make post-secondary education more affordable in the first place. This might include encouraging institutional accountability, streamlining administration, and increasing availability of need-based grants like Pell Grants. By prioritizing accessibility and responsible spending in our education system, we can ensure a more equitable and sustainable model for financing higher education. This approach would require students, educators, and policymakers to work together, rather than relying on blanket debt forgiveness as a simplistic solution."
