## Artificial Advocates: Biasing Democratic Feedback using AI

Written for Apart Research's ["AI x Democracy" hackathon](https://www.apartresearch.com/event/ai-democracy).

Our team's project targeted the vulnerability of U.S. federal agencies' public comment systems to AI-driven manipulation, aiming to highlight how AI can be used to undermine democratic processes. We demonstrated two attack methods: 1) generating a high volume of comments that survey participants found functionally-indistinguishable from human comments (this repo), and 2) producing high-quality forgeries mimicking influential organizations ([repo](https://github.com/simonwisdom/public-comment-generator/), [demo](https://github.com/simonwisdom/public-comment-generator/raw/master/media/side-by-side-demo-small.mp4)). These experiments showcase the challenges in distinguishing authentic from synthetic public participation online where identity verification systems are not implemented.
