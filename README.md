## Artificial Advocates: Biasing Democratic Feedback using AI

The "Artificial Advocates" project by our team targeted the vulnerability of U.S. federal agencies' public comment systems to AI-driven manipulation, aiming to highlight how AI can be used to undermine democratic processes. We demonstrated two attack methods: one generating a high volume of realistic, indistinguishable comments, and another producing high-quality forgeries mimicking influential organizations. These experiments showcased the challenges in detecting AI-generated content, with participant feedback showing significant uncertainty in distinguishing between authentic and synthetic comments.
